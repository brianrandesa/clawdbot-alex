# Henry - Ready to Send Email Template

## EMAIL 1: Main Outreach (READY TO SEND)

**Subject:** Quick question about your next event

**Body:**
```
Hey {{first_name}},

I saw you're hosting {{event_name}} — nice.

Quick question: do you have a system that actually fills seats, or are you running ads and hoping for the best?

We built a done-for-you event sales system that's filled 250+ events and sold 65,000+ tickets. One client sold 3,000 tickets in 3 weeks. Another sold 600 tickets using AI with zero human sales reps.

We install your CRM, build your funnels, launch your ads, and train your team — all in a 7-week sprint. Not a course. A fully built machine.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits?
