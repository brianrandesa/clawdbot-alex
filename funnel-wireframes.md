LET ME GUESS WHAT'S HAPPENING...

### SECTION 7: FAQ SECTION (Critical Missing Element)
```
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

▼ What exactly is included in the $15K investment?
Complete event marketing system: strategy, funnel creation, ad management, 
sales training, and 90 days of hands-on support. Plus our proven templates, 
scripts, and systems that generated $65M for our clients.

▼ How is this different from hiring a marketing agency?
Most agencies just run ads. We provide the complete system: buyer psychology, 
high-converting funnels, sales processes, and backend offer optimization. 
We don't just fill seats—we fill them with buyers who spend money.

▼ What if my event doesn't sell out?
Our 94% success rate speaks for itself, but if we don't deliver, you get 
your $15K back. We've only had 3 events not hit targets in 250 attempts.

▼ Do you work with all industries?
We specialize in business, coaching, real estate, fitness, and high-ticket 
service providers. If you have a backend offer $5K+, we can likely help.

▼ What's the minimum ad spend required?
$10K minimum for 90 days. Most successful clients invest $15-25K in ads 
for optimal results. Ad spend is separate from our $15K system fee.

▼ How quickly will I see results?
Most clients see initial ticket sales within 14 days of launch. Full 
event sellouts typically occur 4-6 weeks before the event date.

YOU'RE NOT QUITE READY FOR OUR $15K SYSTEM
(But Here's How To Get There)

Based on your responses, our premium Event Sales System isn't the right 
fit for your current situation. But that doesn't mean you can't get there!

HERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON FIRST:

If you don't have a backend offer $5K+:
→ Create a high-value program/service to sell at your event
→ Recommended: Start with a $5K-10K coaching or consulting offer

If your marketing budget is under $10K:
→ Focus on growing your business revenue first
→ Remember: You need ad spend + system investment for success

If you don't have an event date:
→ Pick a date 3-6 months out and lock it in
→ Having a deadline creates urgency for both you and attendees
