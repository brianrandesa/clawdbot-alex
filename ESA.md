## CURRENT BUSINESS SITUATION (Early 2026)

### Ad Performance (ESA's own lead gen for ESS offer):
- Monthly ad spend: **~$500**
- Cost per qualified booked call: **~$250**
- Show rate: **~75%**
- **Close rate: <5%** ⚠️ **#1 PROBLEM**
- Getting a lot of non-qualified leads on calls
- Despite low close rate, achieving **8x ROAS** over last 6 months

### The #1 Problem: Sub-5% Close Rate on ESS Sales Calls

**Industry standard:** 20-25%  
**Current:** <5%

**Root Causes:**
- Non-qualified prospects getting on calls (DJs, wedding planners, people who can't afford $15K)
- Messaging confusion (prospects think we sell out their event when reality is we build the system)
- Insufficient follow-up after calls

**Fixes Needed:**
- Better qualification so non-qualified leads don't get on calls
- Better targeting in Meta ads (exclude DJs/wedding planners/party planners)
- Pre-call qualification form
- Follow-up sequence for prospects who don't close on first call
- Better sales scripts with early disqualification
- Hire more closers so Mark isn't the only one

### Malachi Being Out ⚠️

- Malachi (Creative Director) has been out for months due to neck surgery
- This is directly impacting our ads department and client delivery
- When healthy, he handles ad strategy, creative direction, content strategy, weekly studio filming
- **Critical vulnerability right now** — need a plan to cover creative/ads until he returns

### DFY Retainer Issue

- Current pricing: $25K + 50% commission
- **Retainer needs to be higher**
- The commission model works but the upfront doesn't fully cover the cost of deploying a full sales team

---

## 2026 GOALS

### Revenue Target: $5M+ Annual

**Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Scale ESS sales** with more closers and a sales manager
2. **Increase DFY retainer pricing**
3. **Land more enterprise/sports/entertainment DFY clients**
4. **Build team of A-players** to support this growth

### Close Rate Target: 20-25%
- Fix qualification
- Better Meta ads targeting
- Pre-call qualification form
- Follow-up sequences
- Better sales scripts with early disqualification
- Hire more closers

### Team Target: A-Players Only
- Hire 2-3 more ESS Closers
- Hire a Sales Manager to run the sales org
- Get Malachi back healthy and producing
- James fully transitioned to DFY sales
- Denise running operations so Brian stays in CEO lane

### Strategic Aspirations:
- Partnership or acquisition conversation with **Events.com** (CEO is Mitch Thrower)
- Expand into sports, entertainment, and corporate events
- Build toward significant valuation for potential exit
