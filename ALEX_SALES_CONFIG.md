# Henry the Sales Guy - Outbound Configuration

## Email Account
- **Email:** henrythesalesguy@gmail.com
- **Password:** Harrythesalesguy1234
- **Purpose:** Outbound prospecting and lead generation for ESA

## The Pitch
ESA builds done-for-you sales systems that fill events. We install your CRM, launch your funnels, write and set up your ads, build automations, and train your reps — all in a 7-week sprint. Not a course, not coaching — a fully built sales machine.

**Results:** 250+ events filled, 65,000+ tickets sold, $65M+ in revenue generated for clients.

## Client Wins
- **Deontay Wilder's team:** 3,000 tickets sold in 3 weeks
- **Colorado Spartans:** scaled from 3,000 to 5,000 tickets per game
- **Boston faith conference:** 600 tickets sold using AI automation with zero human sales reps

## Target Audience
✅ **YES:**
- Business coaches running live workshops or masterminds
- Consultants hosting conferences or summits
- Speakers doing paid events or retreats
- Course creators running live launches or virtual events
- Anyone with a high-ticket backend offer ($5K+) who uses events as a sales channel

❌ **NO:**
- DJs, wedding planners, party planners, festivals, clubs, photographers, caterers
- (They can't afford $15K and don't have backend offers)

## Key Differentiator
**Most event hosts think they have an ads problem — they actually have a broken event system.**
ESA installs the whole machine, not just one piece.

- Need email warm-up period (gradually increase volume)
- Track: sent, opened, replied, booked, closed
- Focus on high-ticket event hosts with backend offers
