## EOS SALES SCRIPT - ONE PAGE

### OPENING (30 seconds)
**"Hi [CEO Name], I'm Brian Rand. I help $10M-$50M companies in South Dakota break through growth ceilings. Most CEOs I work with are frustrated by three things..."**

### THE 3 FRUSTRATIONS (60 seconds)
1. **LEADERSHIP TEAM CHAOS** - meetings feel unproductive, decisions don't stick
2. **ZERO ACCOUNTABILITY** - people miss numbers and give excuses instead of results
3. **NO CLEAR DIRECTION** - everyone's busy but you're not hitting goals

**"Sound familiar? What I'm describing is hitting the ceiling. Every company your size hits it."**

### EOS SOLUTION (90 seconds)
**"EOS - the Entrepreneurial Operating System - is how 200,000+ companies solved this."**

**6 COMPONENTS THAT FIX EVERYTHING:**
- **VISION** → Everyone 100% aligned on where you're going
- **PEOPLE** → Right people in right seats with core values  
- **DATA** → Know your numbers weekly, not monthly
- **ISSUES** → Solve root causes, not symptoms
- **PROCESS** → Document your 6-8 core processes
- **TRACTION** → 90-day goals that actually get achieved

**"Result: 18% average revenue growth, better team, less stress."**

### QUALIFYING QUESTIONS
1. **"What's your biggest frustration running the business?"**
2. **"How often does your team actually hit their commitments?"**
3. **"What happens when you go on vacation?"**

### CLOSES
**SOFT:** *"Based on what you shared about [their pain], EOS could solve that. Can we grab coffee? Tuesday 10am or Thursday 2pm?"*

**DIRECT:** *"You're at $[X]M with [Y] employees - you're hitting the ceiling. Give me 90 minutes and I'll show you how this works."*

**URGENCY:** *"Every quarter you wait costs growth and profit. I have Thursday 10am open. Can you meet?"*

---

## OBJECTION RESPONSES

**"Too busy"** → *"That's exactly why you need this. EOS gives you back 10+ hours per week."*

**"Tried systems before"** → *"What you tried wasn't EOS. 200,000 companies can't be wrong."*

**"How much?"** → *"$15K investment, typically 10:1 return. But first let's see if you're a fit."*

**"Need to think"** → *"What specifically? The time, cost, or if it works for your industry?"*

---

## INDUSTRY HOOKS

**CONSTRUCTION:** *"EOS helps construction companies run jobs on time, on budget consistently."*

**MANUFACTURING:** *"Manufacturing hits ceilings at $20M - EOS systemizes production and scaling."*

**HEALTHCARE:** *"Healthcare struggles with compliance and staff - EOS aligns everyone around outcomes."*

**PROFESSIONAL SERVICES:** *"Service firms can't scale because they depend on key people. EOS builds systems."*
