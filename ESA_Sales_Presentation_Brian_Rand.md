## SLIDE 1: HOOK - THE EVENT NIGHTMARE

### "The $500,000 Event That Sold 47 Tickets"

**Brian, let me ask you something...**

Have you ever seen an event organizer spend 6 months planning their dream event...

Rent the perfect venue for $15,000...
Book world-class speakers for $25,000...
Invest $50,000 in marketing...

Only to watch **47 people** show up to a room built for 500?

**I've seen it happen 847 times.**

And every single time, they make the same 3 deadly mistakes that kill their ticket sales before they even launch.

*[Pause for impact]*

## SLIDE 2: THE 3 DEADLY EVENT PROBLEMS

### Problem #1: LOW TICKET SALES
- Average event sells only 12-18% of capacity
- Most organizers rely on "hope marketing" 
- No systematic approach to demand generation

### Problem #2: NO PROVEN SYSTEM
- Winging it with random tactics
- No sales funnel or conversion strategy  
- Flying blind without data or tracking

### Problem #3: MANUAL, TIME-CONSUMING PROCESSES
- Manually managing every lead and follow-up
- Spending 60+ hours/week on admin tasks
- Burning out before the event even happens

**Sound familiar?**

---

## SLIDE 3: THE REAL COST OF THESE PROBLEMS

### Here's what this costs you:

**Financially:**
- Average event loses $87,000 due to poor ticket sales
- Wasted marketing spend: $30K-$150K per event
- Lost opportunity cost: $200K+ in potential revenue

**Emotionally:**
- Sleepless nights worrying about attendance
- Embarrassment in front of speakers and sponsors
- Stress that damages relationships and health

**Professionally:**
- Damaged reputation in your industry
- Loss of credibility with future partners
- Career setback that takes years to recover from

### **The question isn't whether you can afford to fix this...**
### **It's whether you can afford NOT to.**
