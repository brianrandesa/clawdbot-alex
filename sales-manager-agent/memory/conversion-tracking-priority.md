# Conversion Tracking - The Real Performance Metric

## Why Conversion Data is Critical
**Activity metrics (dials, talk time) don't equal revenue.**
**Only conversion rates tell us what's actually working.**

## Current Conversion Mystery:
### What We Know:
- **Event A:** ? tickets sold from ? dials
- **Event B:** ? tickets sold from ? dials  
- **Event C:** ? tickets sold from ? dials
- **Total team:** ? conversion rate across 200 dials/day per rep

### What We Need to Find Out:
1. **Conversion rates by event** (which events actually convert?)
2. **Conversion rates by rep** (who's actually closing deals?)
3. **Conversion rates by lead source** (which GHL funnels work?)
4. **Time-to-conversion** (how long from first call to sale?)
5. **Follow-up effectiveness** (GHL sequences that convert)

## Conversion Analysis Framework:
### Event Performance Matrix:
```
EVENT A:
- Leads generated: ?/week
- Dials made: ?/week  
- Conversations: ?/week
- Tickets sold: ?/week
- Conversion rate: ?%
```

### Rep Performance Matrix:
```
ALISHA:
- Event A conversion: ?%
- Event B conversion: ?%
- Event C conversion: ?%
- Overall conversion: ?%
- Best/worst performing events: ?
```

## Key Questions for Conversion Tracking:
1. **Where do we track ticket sales?** (GHL? Separate system?)
2. **Can we tie sales back to specific calls/reps?**
3. **What's the conversion cycle?** (single call? multi-touch?)
4. **How do we track follow-up conversions?** (GHL sequences that close)

## Expected Insights:
- **High-activity, low-conversion reps** need coaching
- **Low-activity, high-conversion reps** need more leads
- **High-converting events** get more resources
- **Low-converting events** get optimization or paused
