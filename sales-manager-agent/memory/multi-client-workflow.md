# Multi-Client Dialing Workflow - ESA Ticket Sales

## Current Structure (Feb 19, 2026)
**Reps dial on multiple events/clients in the same day**

### Active Client Mix:
- **Insurance Lab:** 100 tickets (performing well)
- **Tax Maverick:** 4 tickets (underperforming) 
- **PYP:** 0 tickets (not being worked?)

### Sales Reps (Multi-Client):
- **Alisha West** (PYP focus but multi-client)
- **Chloe** (Insurance Lab focus but multi-client)
- **Emanuela** (Tax Maverick focus but multi-client)  
- **James** (Ops Lead, PYP focus but multi-client)
- **Melissa Kil** (Tax Maverick focus, setup incomplete)

## Critical Management Questions:
1. **Time allocation per client?** (How much of 200 dials goes to each?)
2. **Lead prioritization?** (Which clients get dialed first?)
3. **Performance tracking?** (Results by rep AND by client)
4. **Context switching?** (Scripts/messaging different per client?)
5. **Lead distribution?** (Who decides which rep calls which client's leads?)

## Workflow Complexity:
**Daily Rep Process:**
- Morning: Check all GHL instances for new leads
- Switch between client contexts throughout day
- Track dials/outcomes separately by client
- Different scripts/messaging per event type
- Follow-up sequences vary by client GHL

## Management Challenges:
- **Attention dilution:** Spreading focus across multiple clients
- **Performance attribution:** Is low performance rep or client issue?
- **Priority conflicts:** Which client gets attention when leads compete?
- **Training complexity:** Reps need expertise in multiple event types

## This Explains PYP Problem:
**Possible reasons for 0 tickets:**
1. **No lead flow** (broken funnel in PYP GHL)
2. **Deprioritized by reps** (other clients easier/more rewarding)  
3. **Context switching confusion** (PYP messaging not mastered)
4. **Time allocation issue** (200 dials spread too thin)
