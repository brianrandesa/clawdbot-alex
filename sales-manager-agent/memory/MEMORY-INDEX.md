1. Complete Melissa Kil setup (Kixie + GHL access)
2. Investigate PYP 0-ticket issue (funnel broken? rep performance?)
3. Deploy high-ticket training to Chris

### **Weekly Implementation**
1. Daily management rhythm (9 AM standups, 1 PM check-ins, 5 PM scoreboard)
2. High-ticket CRM tracking system
3. Tax Maverick optimization (3 reps → better than 4 tickets)

### **Strategic (30 Days)**

## 💡 SUCCESS PATTERNS IDENTIFIED

### **What Works**
- 6-month packages (data + optimization cycle)
- Psychology-based selling vs feature-dumping
- ROI calculations using client's revenue gaps
- Complete marketing ecosystem (not just ads)

### **What Needs Fix**
- Data scattered across multiple GHL instances
- No pipeline tracking for high-ticket deals
- Incomplete rep onboarding processes
- PYP funnel/performance issues

### **Key Insights**
- Push 6-month deals: "First 3 months = data gathering, months 4-6 = real scaling"
- Value stack before price: $25K+ in deliverable value for $25K investment
- Client success depends on predictable event attendance (90% capacity minimum)
- Rex exists so Brian can focus on CEO activities, not sales management
