# COMPLETE ESA TEAM STRUCTURE - Updated Feb 19, 2026

## TWO SEPARATE REVENUE STREAMS

### 1. EVENT TICKET SALES (Done-For-You Client Revenue)
**Purpose:** Fill client events with attendees
**Current Load:** 3 active events being filled
**Team Structure:**
- **Alisha West** (multi-event dialing)
- **Chloe** (multi-event dialing) 
- **Emanuela** (multi-event dialing)
- **James** (Ops Lead, multi-event dialing)
- **Melissa Kil** (multi-event dialing, setup incomplete)

**Process:** 
- GHL funnels generate leads for client events
- Reps dial through Kixie (200 dials/day across 3 events)
- Follow-up through GHL SMS/email sequences
- Goal: Fill event seats for clients

### 2. HIGH-TICKET ESA SALES (Direct ESA Revenue)
**Purpose:** Sell ESA's Event Sales System ($15K-$25K packages)
**Team Structure:**
- **Nick** (Closer - ESS packages)
- **Chris** (Closer - ESS packages)
- **[UNKNOWN SETTER]** (Outbound for Nick & Chris)

**Process:**
- Setter generates appointments for Nick & Chris
- Nick & Chris close $15K-$25K ESA service deals
- Revenue flows directly to ESA

## CRITICAL QUESTIONS IDENTIFIED:

### About the Setter:
1. **Who is the setter?** (Name, experience level)
2. **What's their process?** (Cold calling, LinkedIn, referrals?)
3. **Appointment volume?** (How many qualified calls per week for Nick & Chris?)
4. **Performance tracking?** (Setter metrics, conversion rates?)

### About the 3 Events:
1. **Which 3 events?** (Are these Insurance Lab, Tax Mav, PYP or different clients?)
2. **Event timeline?** (When do these events happen?)
3. **Ticket targets?** (How many seats need to be filled for each?)
4. **Performance status?** (Which events are on track, which are behind?)

### Integration Questions:
1. **Lead sources for setter?** (How does setter get prospects for Nick & Chris?)
2. **CRM tracking?** (Pipeline visibility for high-ticket deals?)
3. **Commission structures?** (How are closers and setter compensated?)
4. **Territory/lead distribution?** (How are prospects assigned?)

## MANAGEMENT COMPLEXITY:
- **5 ticket sales reps** working 3 events simultaneously
- **2 high-ticket closers** + 1 setter working ESA direct sales
- **Multiple GHL instances** for event funnels
- **Kixie integration** for all outbound activity
- **Different scripts, processes, and targets** for each revenue stream
