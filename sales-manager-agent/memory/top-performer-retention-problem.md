# Top Performer Retention vs Team Development Dilemma

## The Classic Sales Management Problem Brian Identified:

### Current Situation:
- **Top reps** want to work high-converting events (Insurance Lab - 100 tickets)
- **New reps** get stuck with difficult events (Tax Maverick - 4 tickets, PYP - 0 tickets)
- **Result:** Two-tier system that breeds resentment and turnover

### The Dilemma:
**Option A:** Let top reps work high-converting events
- ✅ Top reps make money and stay happy
- ❌ New reps struggle, make no money, quit
- ❌ Difficult events never get fixed/optimized
- ❌ Creates unsustainable two-tier system

**Option B:** Force top reps to work difficult events
- ✅ New reps get better opportunities
- ❌ Top reps make less money and leave
- ❌ Lose best performers to competitors
- ❌ Revenue drops immediately

## Rex's Strategic Solutions:

### Solution 1: Performance-Based Rotation System
**Top performers "earn" the right to work high-converting events by:**
- Spending X hours/week fixing difficult events
- Training/mentoring new reps on difficult events
- Achieving minimum performance standards across ALL events

### Solution 2: Tiered Commission Structure
**Different commission rates based on event difficulty:**
- High-converting events: Standard commission rate
- Medium-converting events: 1.25x commission rate  
- Difficult events: 1.5x commission rate
- **Makes difficult events financially attractive**

### Solution 3: Team-Based Incentives
**Bonus structure tied to overall team performance:**
- Individual performance + team performance bonuses
- Top reps get extra bonuses for improving team results
- Creates incentive to help rather than compete

### Solution 4: Event Optimization Strategy
**Use top performers to FIX difficult events, not avoid them:**
- Top reps work difficult events for 2 weeks to identify issues
- Document what works, create playbooks
- Train new reps on optimized processes
- Move top reps back to high-converting events once improved

### Solution 5: Career Development Path
**Create advancement opportunities tied to versatility:**
- "Senior Rep" status requires proficiency across all events
- Leadership roles (team leads, trainers) for multi-event experts
- Higher base pay + benefits for proven versatility
