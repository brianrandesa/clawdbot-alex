# High-Ticket Sales Process - Nick & Chris

## Deal Structure Overview
- **Target:** $15K-$25K deals (ESS - Event Sales System)
- **Average Deal:** $20K (6-month preferred)
- **Commission:** TBD (need Brian input)

## Discovery Framework

### Phase 1: Current Situation Analysis
- **Event experience:** First-time vs experienced
- **Current marketing:** What's working/not working  
- **Sales team status:** Internal team vs need DFY sales
- **Timeline pressure:** Quick results needed vs longer-term growth
- **Budget reality:** $15K vs $25K decision factors

### Phase 2: Problem Identification  
- **Lead generation gaps:** Not enough leads in pipeline
- **Conversion issues:** Leads not turning into ticket sales
- **Scaling barriers:** Can't predictably grow event attendance
- **Resource constraints:** No internal marketing expertise

### Phase 3: Solution Positioning
- **3-Month Package ($15K):** Quick wins, proof of concept
- **6-Month Package ($25K):** Full optimization, true scaling
- **Key Message:** "First 3 months = data gathering. Months 4-6 = real growth."

## Objection Handling Scripts

### "Why 6 months vs 3 months?"
**Response:** "Great question. Here's what I've learned working with [X] event organizers - the first 90 days are about getting data and dialing in your positioning. That takes time. The real scaling happens in months 4-6 when we have the data to optimize everything. That's why I prefer 6-month commitments - that's where clients see the biggest ROI."

### "That's expensive"  
**Response:** "I understand. Let's break this down - if we get you just [X] additional tickets at your current price point, this pays for itself. Plus, you're getting our entire marketing stack built for you - ads, funnels, CRM, automations, copy, and either sales training or our sales team. What's the cost of NOT having a predictable lead generation system?"

### "I want to think about it"
**Response:** "Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specifically would you like to think through? Is it the investment level, the timeline, or something else? I'm happy to address any concerns right now."

## Closing Sequence

### Commitment Close
"Based on what you've told me about [specific pain point], and your goal of [specific outcome], which option makes more sense - the 3-month foundation package or the 6-month growth package?"

### Assumptive Close  
"Great, so for the 6-month package, we'll get started with [specific deliverable]. Do you prefer to handle the investment in one payment or would you like to discuss payment terms?"
