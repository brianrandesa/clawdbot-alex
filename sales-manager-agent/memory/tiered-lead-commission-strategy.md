# Tiered Lead & Commission Strategy - Feb 19, 2026

## Lead Inventory Analysis:
### Existing Lead Pool (Cold - Haven't Been Worked):
- **Tier 1:** 500 leads (highest quality, but cold)
- **Tier 2:** 1,000 leads (medium quality, cold)  
- **Tier 3:** 2,500 leads (lowest quality, cold)
- **Total:** 4,000 cold leads in inventory

### Recent Activity (Last Month):
- **100 total leads worked:** 40 qualified, 60 not qualified
- **40% qualification rate** on leads Brian personally worked

### New High-Priority Leads (HOT):
- **AI-Sourced:** 100 top qualified leads
- **VA Manual Research:** 150 dream clients
- **Total:** 250 high-priority prospects
- **Urgency:** All have events in next 90 days
- **Status:** Fresh, not contacted yet

## Commission Structure Recommendation:

### Tier A: Hot Prospects (250 AI + VA leads)
- **Brian does outbound/setting himself**
- **15% commission to Nick/Chris** (justified because no setter cost + highest conversion expected)
- **Expected close rate:** 25-35% (fresh, qualified, urgent)

### Tier B: Warm Prospects (500 Tier 1 leads)  
- **Nick/Chris dial directly**
- **12% commission** (slightly higher due to higher quality)
- **Expected close rate:** 15-20% (good quality but cold)

### Tier C: Standard Prospects (1,000 Tier 2 leads)
- **Nick/Chris dial directly**  
- **10% commission** (standard rate)
- **Expected close rate:** 8-12% (medium quality, cold)

### Tier D: Volume Prospects (2,500 Tier 3 leads)
- **Nick/Chris dial directly**
- **8% commission** (lower quality, volume play)
- **Expected close rate:** 3-5% (lowest quality, cold)

## Strategic Economics:

### Tier A (Hot Prospects) - 15% Commission:
- **250 leads × 30% close rate = 75 deals**
- **75 deals × $20K average = $1.5M revenue**
- **Commission cost:** 15% = $225K
- **ROI:** Massive because these are dream clients with immediate need

### Resource Allocation Strategy:
- **Brian:** Focus 100% on Tier A prospects (highest ROI)
- **Nick:** 70% Tier B, 30% Tier C  
- **Chris:** 70% Tier B, 30% Tier C
- **Future:** Only touch Tier D when others are exhausted
