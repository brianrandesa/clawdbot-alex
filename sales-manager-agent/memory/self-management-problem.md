# Self-Management Problem Identified - Feb 19, 2026

## Current State: "It's up to them until now"
**Problem:** Reps self-allocate time across 3 events with no management oversight

## Predictable Results of Self-Management:
### What Reps Naturally Do:
- **Cherry-pick easier prospects** (avoid difficult conversations)
- **Focus on higher-converting events** (more rewarding success rate)
- **Avoid broken/difficult funnels** (less frustrating work)
- **Follow path of least resistance** (comfort zone bias)

### What This Explains:
- **Uneven performance** across the 3 events
- **Some events get attention, others ignored**
- **Inconsistent daily dial counts** (200/day not enforced)
- **No accountability** for underperformance
- **Process inconsistency** (everyone doing it differently)

## Classic Sales Management Issue:
**Without structure, sales teams optimize for:**
1. **Personal comfort** over company results
2. **Short-term ease** over long-term success  
3. **Individual preferences** over strategic priorities
4. **Avoiding rejection** over maximizing attempts

## Rex's Solution - Structured Management:
### Daily Accountability:
- **Prescribed dial allocation** (specific numbers per event)
- **Performance tracking** by rep AND by event
- **Morning assignments** (who calls what today)
- **End-of-day reporting** (actual vs. target numbers)

### Weekly Optimization:
- **Performance analysis** (identify patterns)
- **Resource reallocation** (put top performers on struggling events)
- **Training focus** (coach based on data, not guesswork)
- **Strategic adjustments** (double down on what works)

## Immediate Impact Expected:
- **Failing events get proper attention**
- **Top performers can't coast** 
- **Underperformers get specific coaching**
- **Overall team performance becomes predictable**
