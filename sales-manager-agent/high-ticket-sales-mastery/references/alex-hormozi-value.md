# Alex Hormozi's Value-Based Selling Framework

**Core Philosophy:** "People don't buy products or services. They buy outcomes and experiences. Price is only an issue in the absence of value."

## The Value Equation

### Formula: Value = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) / (Time Delay + Effort & Sacrifice)

**Dream Outcome:** What they really want to achieve
**Perceived Likelihood:** How confident they are it will work
**Time Delay:** How long until they see results
**Effort & Sacrifice:** What they have to give up or do

**ESA Application:**
- **Dream Outcome:** Predictably full events, consistent revenue
- **Perceived Likelihood:** Case studies, guarantees, track record
- **Time Delay:** Results in 60-90 days, not 12+ months
- **Effort & Sacrifice:** Done-for-you vs. DIY approach

## The Grand Slam Offer Structure

### 1. The Vehicle (Core Mechanism)
**What it is:** The Event Sales System
**Not:** "Marketing services" or "Lead generation"
**But:** "Complete event-filling machine"

### 2. The Outcome (End Result)
**What they get:** Predictably full events every single time
**Specific metrics:** 90% capacity minimum, 30-day advance sellouts
**Transformation:** From stress and uncertainty to confidence and predictability

### 3. The Obstacles (What's in the Way)
**Problem #1:** Unpredictable attendance
**Problem #2:** Wasted ad spend on wrong audiences
**Problem #3:** No systematic follow-up
**Problem #4:** Manual processes that don't scale

### 4. The Solutions (How You Solve Each Problem)
**For Problem #1:** Psychology-based marketing funnels
**For Problem #2:** Precise audience targeting and testing
**For Problem #3:** Automated SMS and email sequences
**For Problem #4:** Complete CRM and automation systems

### Total Stack Value: $25,000+ value
### Your Investment: $25,000 (6 months)
### Net Value: Break-even on deliverables, unlimited upside on results

## The Logical Value Framework

### ROI Calculation Method:
"Let me show you the math on this investment."

**Current Situation Analysis:**
- "What's your average event generate in revenue?"
- "How many people typically attend vs. capacity?"
- "What would that event generate at full capacity?"

**ESA Example:**
- Current: 200 attendees × $200/ticket = $40,000 revenue
- Potential: 500 attendees × $200/ticket = $100,000 revenue
- **Gap: $60,000 lost revenue per event**

**Investment Justification:**
- Investment: $25,000 for 6 months
- Result: $60,000 additional revenue per event
- **Breakeven: Less than 1 successful event**
- **ROI: 240% minimum (if only 1 event improved)**

### The Opportunity Cost Frame:
"The real question isn't whether you can afford to invest $25,000. It's whether you can afford NOT to invest it."

**Cost of Inaction Calculation:**
- Lost revenue per event: $60,000
- Events per year: 4
- **Annual opportunity cost: $240,000**
- **6-month opportunity cost: $120,000**

"So really, this investment costs you nothing. Doing nothing costs you $120,000."

## Objection Destruction Framework

### "It's Too Expensive"
**Hormozi Response Pattern:**

**Step 1 - Reframe the Question:**
"Too expensive compared to what? Compared to losing $60,000 per event? Compared to the stress of never knowing if people will show up?"

**Step 2 - Value Anchor:**
"If I could guarantee your next event would be completely sold out, what would that be worth to you? More or less than $25,000?"

**Step 3 - Logical Proof:**
"Look at the math. You make $60,000 more per event when it's full. This pays for itself with less than one event. Everything after that is pure profit."

### "I Don't Have the Money"
**Step 1 - Separate Want from Affordability:**
"I didn't ask if you had the money. I asked if you wanted the result. Do you want predictably full events?"

**Step 2 - Investment Thinking:**
"Rich people borrow money to make money. If this generates an extra $240,000 per year, wouldn't you find a way to invest $25,000?"

**Step 3 - Payment Options:**
"We can discuss payment terms. Would monthly installments work better for your cash flow?"

### "I Need to Think About It"
**Step 1 - Isolate the Real Concern:**
"What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment amount, the timeline, or whether this will work for your situation?"

**Step 2 - Address the Real Issue:**
[Handle their specific concern with logic and proof]

**Step 3 - Cost of Delay:**
"How many events will you have in the next 6 months while you're thinking about this? At $60,000 lost revenue per event, what's the cost of waiting?"

## The Certainty Ladder

### Level 1: "This Probably Won't Work"
**Your Job:** Provide social proof and risk reversal
**Tools:** Case studies, testimonials, guarantees

### Level 2: "This Might Work for Others, But Not for Me"
**Your Job:** Show similarity and relevance  
**Tools:** Stories of similar clients, specific industry examples

### Level 3: "This Could Work for Me"
**Your Job:** Increase confidence and reduce risk
**Tools:** Detailed implementation plan, success metrics

### Level 4: "This Will Probably Work for Me"
**Your Job:** Remove final obstacles and create urgency
**Tools:** Limited availability, payment plans, bonus inclusions

### Level 5: "This Will Definitely Work for Me"
**Your Job:** Make it easy to say yes
**Tools:** Simple next steps, immediate implementation

## Scarcity and Urgency (Legitimately)

### Legitimate Scarcity Sources:
1. **Capacity Constraints:** "I only work with 10 clients at a time"
2. **Seasonal Timing:** "Results take 90 days, so starting after March means missing summer events"
3. **Team Bandwidth:** "My team is booked through Q2"
4. **Exclusive Access:** "This system isn't available to everyone"

### Creating Urgency Without Being Pushy:
"I want to be straight with you - I'm not going to pressure you into this. But I do want you to understand the real cost of waiting. Every month you delay is another event with uncertain attendance. The math is pretty clear on what that costs."

## The Assumption Close (Hormozi Style)

### Setup Phase:
"Based on everything we've discussed, this seems like a perfect fit. You want predictable events, this system delivers predictable events. You want to eliminate the stress, this eliminates the stress. You want better ROI, this delivers better ROI."

### Assumption Statement:
"So the real question isn't whether to move forward - we've established this makes financial sense. The question is timeline. Do you want to start immediately or wait until next month?"

### Alternative Choice:
"Would you prefer to handle the investment all at once for a discount, or spread it across 6 months for easier cash flow?"

## Value Communication Rules

### Rule 1: Always Stack Value Before Price
Never mention price until they understand the complete value
Lead with outcomes, not features

### Rule 2: Use Their Numbers, Not Yours
Calculate ROI using their current event revenue
Make the math personal to their situation

### Rule 3: Address Value Skepticism Head-On
"You might be thinking this sounds too good to be true..."
Provide proof before they can object

### Rule 4: Separate Price from Value
"The value is $25,000+ in deliverables plus unlimited upside in revenue"
"The investment is $25,000 for 6 months"
"The gap between value and price is your profit"

## Advanced Value Techniques

### The Comparison Close:
"You can hire an ad agency for $3,000/month, a funnel designer for $5,000, a copywriter for $3,000, and try to manage it all yourself. That's $11,000/month with no guarantee of results. Or you can get the proven system for $4,200/month with guaranteed outcomes."

### The Time Value Close:
"How long would it take you to figure this out yourself? If you value your time at $500/hour, and this saves you 200 hours of trial and error, that's $100,000 in time value alone."

### The Experience Close:
"You're not just buying a marketing system. You're buying 5+ years of experience, millions in ad spend optimization, and systems that have filled 50,000+ event seats. How much is that experience worth?"

## Measuring Value Communication Success

**Success Indicators:**
- They ask about implementation, not price
- They calculate their own ROI during the call
- They reference specific value points in their questions
- They ask about next steps before you close

**Failure Indicators:**
- First question is about price
- They focus on features, not outcomes
- They compare you to cheaper alternatives
- They don't engage with value calculations

**Improvement Actions:**
- Stack more value before revealing investment
- Use more specific, relevant examples
- Calculate ROI more clearly with their numbers
- Address value skepticism earlier in presentation
