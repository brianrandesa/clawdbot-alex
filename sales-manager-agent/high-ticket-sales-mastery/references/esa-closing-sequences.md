# ESA Closing Sequences - $15K-$25K Deals

**Framework Fusion:** Cardone's Aggression + Robbins' Psychology + Hormozi's Logic + Brunson's Stories

## The Universal Closing Mindset

### Pre-Close Psychology (Robbins):
- **Your Belief:** This solution will transform their business
- **Your Certainty:** Level 10 that this is the right fit  
- **Your State:** Confident, helpful, outcome-independent
- **Their Need:** They called you because they have problems that need solving

### Closing Signals to Watch For:
- ✅ Asking implementation questions ("When would we start?")
- ✅ Future-focused language ("When this is working...")
- ✅ Specific timeline references ("Our next event is...")
- ✅ Internal team mentions ("I'd need to tell my team...")
- ✅ Budget/payment questions ("Do you offer terms?")

## PRIMARY CLOSING SEQUENCES

### 1. The Assumption Close (Cardone Style)

**Setup:**
"Based on everything we've discussed, this seems like a perfect fit. You want [specific outcome they mentioned], this system delivers that. You need [specific pain point solved], this solves that. The ROI is clear - you make $[amount] more per event when they're full."

**The Close:**
"So the real question isn't whether to move forward - we've established this makes financial sense and solves your problems. The question is implementation timeline."

**Alternative Choices:**
"Would you prefer to start immediately so we can have this working for your [next event], or would beginning [next month] fit your schedule better?"

**Payment Alternative:**
"And would you like to handle the investment all at once for a small discount, or spread it across monthly payments to help with cash flow?"

**Silence:** [Wait for their response - first person to speak loses]

---

### 2. The ROI Close (Hormozi Method)

**Build the Logic:**
"Let me make sure we're clear on the math here. You said your events currently average [X] attendees but could hold [Y]. At $[ticket price], that's $[revenue gap] you're missing per event."

"You have [#] events per year, so that's $[annual opportunity cost] in lost revenue annually. This system costs $25,000 and pays for itself completely if it helps just ONE event go from [current] to [capacity] attendance."

**The Logic Lock:**
"So mathematically, this is a no-brainer. The only question is whether you believe it will work. Given our track record of [results] and our 90-day guarantee, what's your actual risk?"

**The Close:**
"Based on the numbers alone, this makes sense. Should we get started?"

---

### 3. The Certainty Close (Robbins Psychology)

**Certainty Scale:**
"On a scale of 1 to 10, how certain are you that predictable event attendance would transform your business?"
[Wait for answer - should be 9-10]

"Good. Now, on that same scale, how certain are you that this system can deliver that for you?"

**If 8-10:** "Great - let's get started. How would you like to handle the investment?"

**If 6-7:** "What would make this a 10 for you?"
[Address their concerns, then close]

**If 1-5:** "What concerns do you have?"
[Go back to objection handling]

---

### 4. The Story Close (Brunson Framework)

**Success Story:**
"This reminds me of [similar client]. She was in the exact same position - great content, unpredictable attendance, stressed about every event. She had the same concerns you do about the investment."

**The Decision:**
"But she said something that stuck with me: 'I can either invest in a solution, or keep losing money with half-empty events.' She chose to invest."

**The Results:**
"Six months later, her events sell out weeks in advance. She went from averaging 150 attendees to consistently hitting 400. Her event revenue increased by $200,000 that year."

**The Bridge:**
"She told me recently, 'That was the best business decision I've ever made.' I'm looking at your situation, and I see the same opportunity."

**The Close:**
"Are you ready to make the same smart decision she did?"

---

### 5. The Takeaway Close (Cardone Power Move)

**Setup the Takeaway:**
"You know what, maybe this isn't for you. This system is really designed for serious event organizers who are committed to growth and willing to invest in proven solutions."

**Gauge Reaction:**
[Watch their response - they should resist the takeaway]

**Continue the Takeaway:**
"I work with people who understand that cheap solutions don't solve expensive problems. If you're looking for the cheapest option, I'm probably not the right fit."

**The Reversal:**
"Are you someone who invests in quality solutions that get results, or are you shopping for the cheapest option?"

**Close on Their Response:**
"Good - then let's get started with the proven system that works."

---

## ADVANCED CLOSING TECHNIQUES

### 6. The Urgency Close (When Legitimate)

**Create Scarcity:**
"I should mention something important. I only work with [number] clients at a time to ensure quality results. Right now, I have [situation - one spot available, waiting list, etc.]"

**Time Sensitivity:**
"Also, given your event schedule, if we don't start by [date], we won't have the system optimized in time for your [specific event]. That would mean missing out on $[revenue opportunity]."

**The Choice:**
"So we're really talking about two options: secure this spot now and have the system working for your [event], or wait until [next opening] and miss that revenue opportunity."

**The Close:**
"Which makes more sense for your business?"

---

### 7. The Partnership Close (Relationship-Based)

**Reframe the Relationship:**
"I want you to think about this differently. This isn't just a vendor relationship - this is a partnership in your success. When your events are packed, we both win."

**Align Interests:**
"My reputation depends on your results. I only make money if this works for you. We're literally on the same team here."

**The Commitment:**
"I'm ready to commit the next 6 months to making your events predictably successful. The question is - are you ready to commit to solving this problem once and for all?"

**The Close:**
"Should we become partners in making your events consistently successful?"

---

### 8. The Legacy Close (Vision-Based)

**Paint the Vision:**
"Let me ask you something - what kind of event business do you want to build? One that depends on luck and hope, or one that has predictable systems and consistent results?"

**Future Pacing:**
"Imagine it's two years from now. Your events are known for always selling out. People register immediately when you announce them because they know spots fill fast. You're the go-to expert in your industry."

**Current Reality:**
"That's not going to happen with hope and Facebook posts. It happens with proven systems."

**The Choice:**
"You can keep doing what you're doing and hope it gets better, or you can implement the system that creates that future."

**The Close:**
"Which version of your business do you want to build?"

---

## OBJECTION-SPECIFIC CLOSES

### After Price Objection:

**The Value Reset Close:**
"I understand price is a consideration. Let me ask you this - if this was free but didn't work, would that be a good deal? And if this cost twice as much but guaranteed your events would sell out, would that be worth it?"

"You're not buying a $25,000 marketing service. You're buying a $200,000+ increase in annual revenue. That's the cheapest money you'll ever make."

**The Close:**
"Based on the return, this is actually the least expensive option available to you. Should we move forward?"

---

### After "Think About It":

**The Thinking Close:**
"I respect that you want to think this through. Can I ask what you're going to think about that we haven't already covered?"

[Address their specific concern]

"Here's what I've learned - successful people think quickly and act decisively. They don't think their way out of good decisions."

**The Close:**
"You have all the information you need to make the right decision. What's that decision going to be?"

---

### After Authority Objection:

**The Leadership Close:**
"I understand you want to discuss this. Let me ask you - in your business, who makes the decisions about investing in growth and solving major problems?"

[If it's them]: "Then you can make this decision."
[If it's someone else]: "What would you recommend to them based on our conversation?"

**The Close:**
"As the leader, what decision makes the most sense for your business?"

---

## EMERGENCY CLOSES (When They're Walking Away)

### The Last Chance Close:

**Stop the Exit:**
"Wait - before you go, can I ask you one question?"

**The Reality Check:**
"What's going to be different about your event marketing 6 months from now if you don't change anything today?"

**The Truth:**
"You're going to have the same unpredictable attendance, the same stress, the same lost revenue. Nothing changes if nothing changes."

**The Final Close:**
"You have the opportunity right now to solve this problem forever. Are you really going to walk away from that?"

---

### The Ben Franklin Close:

**The Setup:**
"You seem torn about this decision. Let's do what Ben Franklin used to do - make a list."

**The Process:**
"On one side, write down the benefits of moving forward. On the other side, write down the benefits of not moving forward."

[Let them create the list]

**The Close:**
"Based on your own analysis, what's the right decision?"

---

## CLOSING SEQUENCE COMBINATIONS

### The Triple Close (For Difficult Prospects):

**Close #1 - Assumption:**
"Based on our conversation, this makes sense. Should we get started?"

**If No - Close #2 - ROI:**
"Help me understand - you agree the ROI works, you see how this solves your problems. What's holding you back?"
[Handle objection, then] "So let's move forward."

**If Still No - Close #3 - Takeaway:**
"You know what, maybe I'm wrong about this being a fit. What would need to be different for you to invest in solving this problem?"

---

### The Closing Bridge:

**After Each Objection:**
1. Handle the objection completely
2. Confirm their agreement: "Does that make sense?"
3. Bridge back to close: "So let's get started."

**Pattern:**
Handle → Confirm → Close → Repeat
