"[Name], thanks for taking time today. I know your time is valuable, so let's dive right in and see if I can help you solve your event attendance challenges."

### Rapport Building (Robbins Style):
"Before we get started, I'm curious - tell me a little about yourself and what got you into organizing events in the first place."

**Listen for:**
- Their passion/motivation
- How long they've been doing events
- What they enjoy about the business
- Early wins or struggles

### Transition to Business:
"That's great. I can tell you're passionate about [their area]. Now, help me understand your current situation with events..."

## Current Situation Questions (10-12 minutes)

### NEPQ Discovery Sequence:

**Opening Questions:**
"Tell me about your current approach to filling events. How have you been marketing them?"

**Drill Down Questions:**
- "What's been your experience with [their current method]?"
- "How consistent are your attendance numbers from event to event?"
- "What does your typical timeline look like from planning to event day?"
- "Walk me through your last event - how did that go?"

**Current State Mapping:**
- "What's your average attendance vs. your target capacity?"
- "How far in advance do you typically know if an event will be successful?"
- "What platforms are you currently using for marketing?"

### Values Elicitation (Robbins):
"What's most important to you when it comes to your events?"
**Probe deeper:** "What else matters to you?" (Repeat 3-4 times)

**Common ESA Client Values:**
- Predictability/certainty
- Impact/reaching people

- Financial success
- Work-life balance

## Problem Identification (8-10 minutes)

### NEPQ Problem Questions:

**Assumptive Problem Questions:**
- "What challenges, if any, have you run into with unpredictable attendance?"
- "How much of a concern is it when you're not sure if an event will hit your numbers?"
- "What frustrations have you experienced with your current marketing approach?"

**Problem Amplification:**
- "How long has this been going on?"
- "What have you tried to fix this?"
- "What other areas of your business does this impact?"

### Emotional Problem Questions (Robbins Psychology):
- "How does the uncertainty around attendance make you feel?"
- "What's the stress level like in the weeks leading up to an event?"
- "How is this affecting your confidence in planning future events?"

## Implication Development (8-10 minutes)

### NEPQ Implication Questions:

**Business Impact:**
- "What happens to your business if you can't predictably fill events?"
- "If this continues for another 6-12 months, where do you see things heading?"
- "What opportunities might you be missing with inconsistent attendance?"

**Financial Consequences:**
- "What's the revenue difference between a half-full event and a sold-out event?"
- "How does uncertain attendance affect your ability to plan and invest in growth?"
- "What's the cost to your reputation if events don't meet expectations?"

**Personal Cost:**
- "How is this uncertainty affecting you personally?"
- "What's the stress doing to your relationships or health?"
- "How would it feel to know 30 days in advance that your event would be packed?"

### Story Integration (Brunson):
"You know, what you're describing reminds me of a client I worked with last year. She was organizing leadership events, just like you, and told me the exact same thing - 'I spend months creating incredible content, but I never know if anyone will actually show up.' 

The stress was killing her. She'd be up at 2 AM two weeks before events, refreshing her registration numbers. Sound familiar?"

## Solution Presentation (12-15 minutes)

### Origin Story (Brunson Framework):
"Let me tell you why I created the Event Sales System and how it works..."

[Use the ESA origin story from the Russell Brunson framework]

### Value Stack Presentation (Hormozi Style):
"Here's exactly what we do for you - and I want you to think about the value of each piece:

**Component 1: Targeted Ad Campaigns**
We don't just boost posts. We create psychology-based ad campaigns that find the exact people who should be at your events and compel them to register. If you hired an ad agency, this alone would cost $2,000+ per month.

**Component 2: High-Converting Funnels**  
When someone clicks your ad, they don't just see a registration page. They enter a conversion experience that educates, builds value, creates urgency, and handles objections. A professional funnel designer would charge $5,000+ just for setup.

**Component 3: CRM & Automation**
Every lead is tracked, every follow-up is automated. Nothing falls through the cracks. This level of automation typically costs $1,000+ monthly to maintain.

**Component 4: Professional Copy & Messaging**
All your headlines, emails, ads, and sales copy written by conversion experts, not just 'pretty writing.' Professional copywriters charge $3,000+ for this level of work.

**Component 5: SMS Marketing System**  
Text campaigns that get 95% open rates vs. 20% for email. SMS platforms and management typically cost $500+ monthly.

**Component 6: Email Marketing Sequences**
Nurture campaigns that convert people over time, not just one-and-done blasts. This level of email marketing costs $1,500+ in setup and management.

**Component 7: Sales System**
Either we train your team or provide done-for-you sales to convert inquiries into ticket buyers. Sales training alone costs $5,000+, or we handle it at 50% commission.

That's over $25,000 in value you'd pay if you hired each specialist separately."

### The Framework (Teaching Moment):
"Let me explain the 3-part system that makes this work:

**Part 1 - The Perfect Prospect Magnet:** We identify exactly who should be at your events and create messaging that makes them say 'I need to be there.'

**Part 2 - The Decision Journey:** When they click, they enter a psychological experience that educates them on why they need this event, builds the value, and compels them to register.

**Part 3 - The Attendance Assurance System:** We don't just get registrations - we ensure people actually show up through SMS, email, and retargeting."

## Investment Presentation (3-5 minutes)

### ROI Calculation (Hormozi Method):
"Before I share the investment, let me ask you - what would your last event have generated in revenue if it was completely sold out instead of [their current percentage]?"

**Calculate with their numbers:**
"So that's [difference] in additional revenue from just ONE event being full instead of half-full. Is that accurate?"

### Investment Frame:
"The investment for the complete 6-month Event Sales System is $25,000."

**Immediate Value Stack:**
"Now, remember - that's $25,000+ in deliverable value alone, before we even talk about the results. And based on your numbers, this pays for itself if we increase just one event's attendance from [current] to [capacity]."

## Need-Payoff Questions (5-7 minutes)

### NEPQ Vision Questions:
- "If you had this system working for you, how would that change your business?"
- "What would it mean to you if you could know with 90% certainty your event would sell out?"
- "How would your stress levels change if event marketing was completely handled for you?"
- "What would predictable event attendance allow you to focus on instead?"

### Future Pacing (Robbins):
"Picture this - it's 6 months from now. Your next event is 30 days away, and you're already at 90% capacity. How does that feel compared to the uncertainty you have now?"

## Objection Handling (5-10 minutes)

### Price Objection:
**"That's expensive."**

"You're absolutely right - $25,000 IS a lot of money. Can I ask you something though? What's it costing you right now NOT to have predictable events? Based on your numbers, you're losing [amount] per event that's not full. How many events is that per year?"

### Think About It:
**"I need to think about it."**

"Absolutely, this is an important decision. What specifically would you like to think through? Is it the investment amount, the timeline, or whether this will work for your situation?"

### Money Objection:
**"I don't have that kind of money."**

"I understand. Can I ask you something - if this generated an extra $100,000 in event revenue over the next year, would you figure out how to invest $25,000? The real question is whether you believe this will generate results, not whether you have cash sitting around."

## Closing Sequence (3-5 minutes)

### Assumption Close:
"Based on everything we've discussed, this seems like a perfect fit. You want predictable events, this system delivers that. You want to eliminate the stress, this eliminates the stress. The numbers work out clearly in your favor.

Do you want to get started immediately, or would beginning next month work better for your timeline?"

### Alternative Choice Close:
"Two quick questions - would you prefer the 3-month foundation package to test it out, or the full 6-month system to get maximum results? And would you like to handle the investment all at once, or would monthly payments work better?"

### Urgency Close (Only if true):
"I should mention - I only work with [X] clients at a time to ensure results. I have one spot opening up [timeframe]. If you want to secure that spot, we'd need to move forward today."

## Follow-Up & Next Steps (2-3 minutes)

### If Yes:
"Excellent choice. Here's what happens next:
1. I'll send the agreement within 24 hours
2. We'll schedule our onboarding call for this week  
3. My fulfillment team will be in touch within 72 hours
4. We'll have your first campaigns live within 14 days"

### If Not Today:
"No problem. Based on our conversation, I think this could be a great fit when you're ready. What would need to happen for you to move forward? Is it timing, budget, or something else?"

**Follow-up Schedule:**
- Day 3: Value-focused email with case study
- Day 7: "Thought you'd find this interesting" resource
- Day 14: "Any questions come up?" check-in
- Day 30: New case study + limited availability
