# Grant Cardone's 10X Sales Methodology

**Core Philosophy:** "The sale starts when the customer says no."

## The 10X Sales Process

### 1. Greeting & Rapport (2 minutes max)
- **Purpose:** Establish dominance and control
- **Energy:** High, confident, outcome-independent
- **Focus:** Get to business quickly, don't waste time

**ESA Examples:**
- "Brian, thanks for taking time today. I know your time is valuable, so let's dive right in."
- "I've reviewed your business, and I think I can help you 10X your event attendance. Let's see if this makes sense."

### 2. Qualification (Problem Awareness)
- **Purpose:** Confirm they have problems worth solving
- **Method:** Direct, assumptive questioning
- **Goal:** Get agreement on pain points

**ESA Scripts:**
- "So you're struggling with unpredictable event attendance, right?"
- "The reason you're here is because your current marketing isn't getting you the results you want, correct?"
- "You need a system that predictably fills events, otherwise you wouldn't be talking to me."

### 3. Value Proposition (Solution Presentation)
- **Purpose:** Present as THE solution, not A solution
- **Style:** Confident, outcome-focused
- **Message:** This is what winners do

**ESA Presentation:**
"Here's exactly what we're going to do for you. We're going to build you a complete marketing machine - ads, funnels, CRM, automation, copy, SMS, email, and either train your sales team or provide ours. This isn't just marketing services - this is a predictable revenue system for your events."

### 4. Price Presentation
- **Delivery:** Confident, no apologizing for price
- **Frame:** Investment in their success, not a cost
- **Expectation:** They will have objections, and that's normal

**ESA Price Scripts:**
- "The investment for 6 months of this complete system is $25,000."
- "To get this entire marketing machine built and managed for you is $25K for six months."
- "This is $25,000, and honestly, if that sounds like a lot, you're not ready for this level of growth."

### 5. Objection Handling (The Money Phase)
**Cardone's Golden Rule:** "Never argue, always agree and redirect"

## The 5-Step Objection Process

### Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE
Never fight the objection. Agree completely.

**Price Objection Example:**
Prospect: "That's expensive."
Response: "You're absolutely right, $25,000 IS a lot of money."

### Step 2: CLARIFY  
Understand the real objection behind the stated objection.

"When you say it's expensive, help me understand - is it that you don't have $25K available, or you're not seeing how this creates more value than it costs?"

### Step 3: ISOLATE
Confirm this is the only obstacle to moving forward.

"So if I can show you exactly how this $25K investment returns multiples of that amount, and we can work out terms that make sense, is there anything else that would prevent you from moving forward?"

### Step 4: PRESENT
Address the real concern with logic and emotion.

**For "Too Expensive":**
"I understand. Let me ask you this - what's it costing you right now NOT to have predictable event attendance? If you typically want 500 people at an event and you're only getting 200, what's the lost revenue from those 300 empty seats? This system pays for itself with just ONE successful event."

### Step 5: CLOSE
Assume the sale and move toward action.

"So let's get started. Do you want to handle the investment all at once or would monthly work better for you?"

## Cardone's Closes

### The Alternative Choice Close
"Would you prefer the 3-month package to test it out, or go with the full 6-month system to get maximum results?"

### The Takeaway Close
"You know what, maybe this isn't for you. This is really designed for event organizers who are serious about dominating their market."

### The Urgency Close
"I can only take on 3 new clients this quarter. If you want one of those spots, we need to move today."

### The Certainty Close
"Look, I'm so confident this will work for you that if you don't see results in 90 days, we'll refund your investment. The only question is - are you ready to 10X your events or not?"

### The Assumption Close
"Great, so let's get the paperwork started. I'll need your business details for the contract."

## Advanced Objection Destroyers

### "I Need to Think About It"
**Cardone Response:**
"Absolutely, this is a big decision. What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the money, the timeline, or something else? Let's think through it together right now."

**Follow-up:**
"Successful people make decisions quickly and change them slowly. Unsuccessful people make decisions slowly and change them quickly. Which one are you?"

### "I Need to Talk to My Partner/Spouse"
"I completely understand. What do you think their main concerns will be?"
[Address concerns]
"When you talk to them, make sure you explain the cost of doing nothing. What's it worth to have predictable event revenue?"

### "Can You Send Me Some Information?"
"I could, but that's not going to help you. You've got all the information you need right here. The question is - are you ready to solve this problem or are you going to keep suffering with unpredictable events?"

### "I Don't Have the Money"
"I didn't ask if you had the money, I asked if you wanted to solve the problem. Rich people borrow money to make money. If this generates $100K in additional revenue, wouldn't you figure out how to invest $25K?"

## Cardone's Mindset Rules

### Rule 1: Control the Sale
- YOU set the agenda
- YOU control the pace  
- YOU decide when it's over
- Never let the prospect control the conversation

### Rule 2: Create Urgency
- "Limited spots available"
- "Price increases next month" 
- "This offer expires Friday"
- "I can only help people who are ready to act now"

### Rule 3: Stay in the Future
- Focus on their success AFTER they buy
- "When you're consistently selling out events..."
- "Once your revenue becomes predictable..."
- "After we build your marketing machine..."

### Rule 4: Never Apologize for Price
- Your solution is worth MORE than you're charging
- Cheap solutions don't solve expensive problems
- "You get what you pay for in business"

### Rule 5: Follow Up Relentlessly
- "The fortune is in the follow-up"
- Most sales happen after the 5th contact
- "No" means "not right now," not "never"

## 10X Closing Statements

### The Commitment Close:
"So you're telling me you want to keep struggling with inconsistent events when I can solve this problem in 90 days? That doesn't make sense to me."

### The Success Close:
"Every successful event organizer I work with has this system. The question is - do you want to be successful or do you want to keep struggling?"

### The Reality Close:
"Here's the reality - you can either invest $25K to solve this problem, or you can keep losing money with unpredictable events. Which makes more sense?"

### The Legacy Close:
"What kind of business do you want to build? One that depends on luck, or one that has predictable systems? This is your chance to build something real."
