# ESA Objection Handling Responses - $15K-$25K Deals

**Framework:** Cardone's 5-Step Process + Robbins Psychology + Hormozi Logic

## The Universal Objection Response Pattern

### Step 1: ACKNOWLEDGE (Never Fight)
"You're absolutely right..." / "I completely understand..." / "That makes total sense..."

### Step 2: CLARIFY (Find the Real Issue)
"When you say [objection], help me understand..." / "What specifically concerns you about..."

### Step 3: ISOLATE (Remove Other Obstacles)
"If I could address [concern], is there anything else that would prevent you from moving forward?"

### Step 4: PRESENT (Address with Logic + Emotion)
[Use relevant response from below]

### Step 5: CLOSE (Assume the Sale)
"So let's get started..." / "How would you like to handle the investment?"

## PRICE OBJECTIONS

### "That's expensive" / "That's a lot of money"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"You're absolutely right - $25,000 IS a lot of money. I'd be concerned if you thought it wasn't."

**CLARIFY:**
"When you say it's expensive, help me understand - is it that you don't have $25K available right now, or you're not seeing how this creates more value than it costs?"

**ISOLATE:**
"If I can show you exactly how this investment returns multiples in additional event revenue, is there anything else that would prevent you from moving forward?"

**PRESENT (Hormozi ROI):**
"Let me show you the math. You said your events currently get [X] attendees but could hold [Y]. At $[ticket price], that's $[revenue gap] in lost revenue per event. 

You have [#] events per year, so that's $[annual opportunity cost] you're losing. This system costs $25K and pays for itself if it increases attendance at just ONE event. Everything after that is pure profit.

The real question isn't whether you can afford to invest $25K - it's whether you can afford to keep losing $[opportunity cost] per year."

**CLOSE:**
"Based on the numbers, this makes complete financial sense. Would you prefer to handle the investment all at once or spread it over monthly payments?"

---

### "I don't have that kind of money"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I understand - cash flow is important in any business."

**CLARIFY:**
"When you say you don't have the money, is it that you don't have $25K liquid right now, or you don't see how this generates enough return to justify the investment?"

**ISOLATE:**
"If we could work out terms that fit your cash flow, and you were confident this would generate significant additional revenue, would that work?"

**PRESENT (Investment Thinking):**
"Can I ask you something? If I showed you a guaranteed way to make $100K in additional revenue over the next year, would you find a way to invest $25K? That's exactly what we're talking about here.

Successful business owners borrow money to make money. The question isn't whether you have $25K sitting in your account - it's whether you believe this will generate significantly more than $25K in return."

**PAYMENT OPTIONS:**
"We can work with your cash flow. We offer:
- Monthly payments over 6 months ($4,200/month)
- Quarterly payments ($8,500/quarter)  
- Or we can discuss other arrangements

The key is getting started so you stop losing $[opportunity cost] with every event."

**CLOSE:**
"Which payment structure works best for you?"

---

### "I can get marketing cheaper elsewhere"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"You're absolutely right - you can definitely find cheaper marketing services."

**CLARIFY:**
"When you mention cheaper options, are you comparing this to hiring an ad agency, doing it yourself, or something else?"

**PRESENT (Value Distinction):**
"Here's the difference - we're not just a marketing service. Let me break down what you'd actually need to get the same results:

- Ad agency: $3,000/month minimum
- Funnel designer: $5,000 setup + $1,000/month
- Copywriter: $3,000 for professional copy  
- CRM specialist: $1,000/month management
- Email marketing: $500/month
- SMS platform: $300/month
- Sales training: $5,000

That's $18,000+ just in setup costs, plus $5,800/month ongoing - and you'd have to manage 6 different vendors with no guarantee they work together.

We give you the complete integrated system for $4,200/month, managed by one team, with a track record of filling 50,000+ event seats."

**STORY (Brunson):**
"I had a client who tried the 'cheaper' route first. He spent $8,000 with three different vendors over 4 months. Know what happened? His event had 40% attendance and he lost $60,000 in potential revenue. 

He called me and said, 'I should have just hired you first.' Sometimes cheap costs more than expensive."

**CLOSE:**
"Do you want the proven system that works, or do you want to experiment with cheaper options and risk your next event?"

---

## TIMING OBJECTIONS

### "I need to think about it"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Absolutely - this is an important decision and you should think it through."

**CLARIFY:**
"What specifically do you need to think about? Is it the investment amount, the timeline, whether this will work for your situation, or something else?"

**Address Their Specific Concern:**
[Handle whatever they mention specifically]

**PRESENT (Cost of Delay):**
"I want you to think about this thoroughly, and I also want you to think about the cost of waiting. How many events will you have in the next 6 months while you're thinking about this?

At $[revenue gap] in lost revenue per event, what's the real cost of thinking about it for [timeline]? Sometimes the cost of waiting is higher than the cost of acting."

**STORY (Brunson):**
"Can I tell you about Lisa? She said the exact same thing - 'I need to think about it.' Three months later, she called me back after another half-empty event cost her $50,000 in potential revenue.

I had to tell her I was booked for 4 months. She ended up waiting 7 months total to get started and missed 3 events that could have been successful."

**CLOSE:**
"What would need to happen for you to feel comfortable moving forward today?"

---

### "Now isn't the right time"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I understand timing is important."

**CLARIFY:**
"When you say now isn't the right time, what would need to change for it to be the right time?"

**PRESENT (Timing Reality):**
"Here's what I've learned about timing in 5+ years of helping event organizers - there's never a 'perfect' time to fix your marketing. There's always another event to plan, another fire to put out.

But here's the reality: every month you wait is another event with uncertain attendance. The best time to fix this was 6 months ago. The second-best time is right now."

**URGENCY (If True):**
"Results take 60-90 days to fully optimize. If you want this working for your [next major event], we'd need to start in the next two weeks."

**CLOSE:**
"What's more important - waiting for the 'perfect' time that may never come, or solving this problem so your next event is predictable?"

---

## SKEPTICISM OBJECTIONS

### "This sounds too good to be true"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I completely understand that skepticism - if someone promised me predictable event attendance, I'd be skeptical too."

**CLARIFY:**
"What specifically sounds too good to be true? The results we're promising, the process, or something else?"

**PRESENT (Proof & Reality):**
"Let me be completely transparent about what this is and isn't:

**What this IS:**
- A proven system that's filled 50,000+ event seats
- Psychology-based marketing that works better than amateur approaches
- A complete done-for-you solution so you don't have to figure it out

**What this ISN'T:**
- Magic or overnight success
- Guaranteed to work without good event content
- A 'set it and forget it' solution that requires zero involvement from you

The results are real because the system is comprehensive. Most event organizers are trying to compete with Facebook posts against people who understand conversion psychology. It's not a fair fight."

**SOCIAL PROOF:**
"Here are three clients with similar businesses to yours who got these exact results: [specific case studies with numbers]"

**RISK REVERSAL:**
"I'm so confident this works that if you don't see measurable improvement in your event attendance within 90 days, we'll refund your entire investment. I can only make that guarantee because I know the system works."

**CLOSE:**
"Given the guarantee, what's your real risk in trying this?"

---

### "How do I know you can deliver what you promise?"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"That's exactly the right question to ask - you should absolutely verify we can deliver."

**PRESENT (Track Record):**
"Here's how you can verify our ability to deliver:

**Our Track Record:**
- 50,000+ event seats filled using this system
- [X]% of clients see results within 90 days
- Average attendance increase of [X]% in first 6 months

**Client References:**
I can connect you with 3 clients in similar industries who will tell you about their experience. Would that help?

**Risk Reversal:**
We guarantee results or full refund within 90 days. I can only make that promise because I'm confident in delivery.

**Phased Approach:**
You'll see early indicators within 30 days - lead flow, engagement metrics, registration improvements. You don't have to wait 6 months to know it's working."

**CLOSE:**
"What would give you confidence that we can deliver these results for you?"

---

## AUTHORITY OBJECTIONS

### "I need to talk to my partner/spouse"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Absolutely - if this affects your family or business partner, they should be part of the decision."

**CLARIFY:**
"When you talk to them, what do you think their main concerns will be?"

**ADDRESS LIKELY CONCERNS:**
"Let me help you think through how to present this:

**If they're concerned about money:**
Show them the ROI calculation we just did. At $[opportunity cost] per year in lost revenue, this pays for itself quickly.

**If they're concerned about risk:**
Mention the 90-day money-back guarantee. What's the risk in trying something that's guaranteed?

**If they're concerned about time/distraction:**
This is designed to save you time, not take more. It's done-for-you, not done-with-you."

**PRESENT (Decision Timeline):**
"How long do you typically need for these conversations? I ask because I only work with [X] clients at a time, and I have [availability situation]. I'd hate for you to decide yes and then have to wait months to start."

**CLOSE:**
"When will you be able to have that conversation, and when should I follow up?"

---

### "I need to research this more"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"Research is smart - you should understand what you're investing in."

**CLARIFY:**
"What specifically would you like to research? The methodology, our track record, similar solutions, or something else?"

**PROVIDE RESOURCES:**
"I want you to have all the information you need. I can provide:
- Case studies from similar clients
- References you can speak with directly
- Technical details about our process
- Comparison with other approaches

What would be most helpful?"

**PRESENT (Analysis Paralysis Warning):**
"I encourage research, and I also want to share something I've learned. Most successful people research enough to feel confident, then act. Unsuccessful people research forever looking for guarantees that don't exist.

The question is: what would you need to know to feel confident about moving forward?"

**CLOSE:**
"How much research feels like enough, and what's your timeline for making this decision?"

---

## FEATURE/PROCESS OBJECTIONS

### "I don't understand how this works"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"That's a great question - you should understand the process before investing."

**SIMPLIFY THE EXPLANATION:**
"Let me break it down simply:

**Step 1:** We identify exactly who should be at your events and where they spend time online.

**Step 2:** We create ads and content that make those people say 'I need to be at this event.'

**Step 3:** When they click, they go through a psychological journey that educates them, builds value, and compels them to register.

**Step 4:** We follow up with SMS, email, and retargeting to ensure people who register actually attend.

The result: predictable, full events instead of hoping people show up."

**ANALOGY:**
"Think of it like a restaurant that's always packed versus one that's sometimes empty. The packed restaurant has a system - location, marketing, experience, follow-up. They don't just 'hope' people come. That's what we build for your events."

**CLOSE:**
"Does that make sense, or would you like me to explain any part in more detail?"

---

### "This seems complicated"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I can see how it might seem complicated from the outside."

**PRESENT (Simplicity for Them):**
"Here's the beautiful thing - it's complicated for us to build and manage, but simple for you to benefit from. You don't need to understand how your car engine works to drive it successfully.

Your involvement is:
- Approve the marketing messaging
- Provide event details and content
- Review performance reports
- Collect registrations and revenue

We handle everything else - the ads, funnels, follow-up, optimization, all of it."

**CLOSE:**
"Would you rather have a simple system that doesn't work, or a sophisticated system that works automatically for you?"

---

## COMPETITIVE OBJECTIONS

### "I'm already working with [competitor]"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"That's great - it shows you understand the importance of marketing your events."

**CLARIFY:**
"How are the results so far? Are you getting the predictable attendance you want?"

**If Results Are Poor:**
"It sounds like you're not getting the results you need. The question is: do you want to keep getting the same results, or try something that works better?"

**If Results Are Good:**
"That's excellent - you're ahead of most event organizers. What made you want to explore other options?"

**PRESENT (Differentiation):**
"Here's what might be different about our approach:
[Specific differentiators based on their current provider]

The real test is results. If your current solution was giving you consistently full events, you probably wouldn't be talking to me."

**CLOSE:**
"What would your current provider need to improve for you to be completely satisfied?"

---

## INTERNAL OBJECTIONS

### "I don't have time for this right now"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I completely understand - event organizers are incredibly busy."

**CLARIFY:**
"When you say you don't have time, is it that you're concerned about time to implement this, or time to manage it ongoing?"

**PRESENT (Time Savings):**
"This is designed to save you time, not cost you time. Right now, you're spending time:
- Worrying about attendance
- Manually posting on social media  
- Managing random marketing efforts
- Stressing about whether events will be successful

This system runs automatically. You'll get more time back than you put in."

**TIME COST CALCULATION:**
"How much time are you spending right now on marketing and worrying about attendance? 10 hours per week? 20? At your hourly value of $[their rate], that's $[cost] per month in time you could be using elsewhere."

**CLOSE:**
"Would you rather spend 2 hours per week managing a system that works, or 20 hours per week on activities that don't?"

---

### "I want to try some things myself first"

**ACKNOWLEDGE:**
"I respect that - you're obviously capable and want to understand your business."

**CLARIFY:**
"What specifically are you thinking of trying?"

**PRESENT (Opportunity Cost):**
"I encourage learning, and I want you to consider the cost of trial and error. How many events will you have while you're experimenting? At $[revenue gap] per event that's not full, what's the cost of the education?

If you value your time at $[rate]/hour, and this takes 200 hours to figure out, that's $[cost] in time alone, plus the lost revenue from events during the learning period."

**EXPERTISE FACTOR:**
"You're great at [their expertise area]. We're great at event marketing. Would you try to [complex task in their field] yourself, or hire an expert? Same principle applies here."

**STORY (Brunson):**
"I had a client who said the same thing. After 6 months of DIY attempts and two disappointing events, he called me and said, 'I should have just hired you first and focused on what I'm good at.'"

**CLOSE:**
"What's more valuable - the satisfaction of figuring it out yourself, or the results of having predictably full events while you focus on creating amazing content?"

---

## CLOSING AFTER OBJECTION HANDLING

### The Assumptive Close:
"Based on our conversation, it sounds like you understand the value and the ROI makes sense. The main question is timing - would you like to get started immediately or wait until [next logical time period]?"

### The Alternative Choice Close:
"Two quick questions: Would you prefer the 3-month package to get started or the full 6-month system for maximum results? And would monthly payments or quarterly payments work better for your cash flow?"

### The Summary Close:
"Let me make sure I understand - you want predictable event attendance, you see how this creates better ROI than your current approach, and the guarantee removes the risk. Is there any reason we shouldn't move forward today?"

### The Urgency Close (Only if legitimate):
"I should mention - I only work with [X] clients at a time to ensure quality results. I have one spot available now, but my next opening isn't until [timeframe]. Given your event schedule, which would work better for you?"
