# Jeremy Miner's NEPQ Framework

**NEPQ = Neuro Emotional Persuasion Questioning**

## Core Philosophy
"Questions are the answer. The right questions create buying emotions, wrong questions create sales resistance."

## The 4-Pillar NEPQ Structure

### 1. Current Situation Questions
**Purpose:** Establish status quo without triggering sales resistance
**Tone:** Curious consultant, not aggressive salesperson

**ESA Event Marketing Examples:**
- "Tell me about your current approach to filling events."
- "What's been your experience with marketing for events in the past?"
- "How are you currently generating leads for your events?"
- "What does your typical event attendance look like?"
- "Walk me through how you've been promoting events up until now."

**Key Phrases:**
- "Help me understand..."
- "Tell me about..."  
- "What's been your experience with..."
- "How have you been handling..."

### 2. Problem Questions
**Purpose:** Surface problems without making them defensive
**Technique:** Third-person stories and assumptive language

**ESA Examples:**
- "What challenges, if any, have you run into with inconsistent event attendance?"
- "How much of a concern is it when you're not sure if you'll hit your attendance goals?"
- "What happens if you continue with the same marketing approach you've been using?"
- "Many event organizers tell me their biggest frustration is not knowing if people will actually show up. Is that something you can relate to?"

**Problem Amplification:**
- "How long has this been going on?"
- "What other areas of your business does this impact?"
- "What have you tried to fix this?"

### 3. Implication Questions  
**Purpose:** Create emotional urgency by exploring consequences
**Focus:** Cost of inaction, not just benefits of action

**ESA Examples:**
- "What happens to your business if you can't predictably fill events?"
- "How does the stress of uncertain attendance affect you personally?"
- "What opportunities might you be missing by not having a predictable system?"
- "If this continues for another 6-12 months, where do you see your business being?"
- "What's the cost to your reputation if events don't meet expectations?"

**Emotion Builders:**
- "How does that make you feel?"
- "What's that doing to your stress levels?"
- "How is this affecting your team/family?"

### 4. Need-Payoff Questions
**Purpose:** Get THEM to sell themselves on the solution
**Method:** Have them visualize the benefits

**ESA Examples:**
- "If you had a system that could predictably fill your events, how would that change your business?"
- "What would it mean to you if you could know with 90% certainty that your event would hit capacity?"
- "How would your stress levels change if event marketing was handled completely for you?"
- "If leads were automatically flowing to your phone every day, what would that allow you to focus on?"
- "What would predictable event attendance do for your revenue planning?"

## NEPQ Conversational Flow

### Opening Sequence:
"I'm curious - tell me about your current situation with event marketing. What's been your experience so far?"

### Transition to Problems:
"Interesting. What challenges, if any, have you run into with [their current situation]?"

### Amplify Implications:  
"So if I understand correctly, when [problem] happens, it impacts [consequence]. How does that make you feel?"

### Bridge to Solution:
"If there was a way to eliminate [problem] so you could [desired outcome], would that be worth exploring?"

## Advanced NEPQ Techniques

### The Callback
Reference earlier problems when presenting solutions:
"Remember when you mentioned [specific problem]? This is exactly what solves that."

### The Future Pace
"Six months from now, when your events are consistently selling out, what will that have done for your business?"

### The Takeaway
"This might not be for everyone. It's really designed for serious event organizers who are committed to growth."

## Tonality Rules

1. **Curious, not interrogating** - Like a concerned consultant
2. **Assumptive language** - "What challenges have you run into" (assumes challenges exist)
3. **Third-person stories** - "Other clients tell me..." (reduces resistance)
4. **Emotional tone matching** - Match their energy level
5. **Pause power** - Let them fill the silence

## Common NEPQ Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Asking leading questions**: "Don't you think you need better marketing?"
✅ **Ask assumptive questions**: "What challenges have you had with your current marketing?"

❌ **Jumping to solutions**: "We can fix that with our system"
✅ **Explore implications**: "What happens if that continues?"

❌ **Aggressive tone**: "Why haven't you fixed this?"
✅ **Curious tone**: "Help me understand what you've tried so far"

## ESA-Specific NEPQ Scripts

### Discovery Opening:
"I'm excited to learn more about your events and what you're working on. To make sure I can give you the best guidance, help me understand your current situation. Tell me about how you've been marketing your events up until now."

### Problem Identification:
"What I'm hearing from a lot of event organizers is that their biggest challenge isn't creating great content - it's getting predictable attendance. Is that something you can relate to?"

### Implication Development:
"So when you're not sure if people will show up, what does that do to your planning? How does that uncertainty affect you personally?"

### Need-Payoff Delivery:
"If you had a system where leads were automatically generated, nurtured, and converted into ticket buyers - and it was all done for you - how would that change your business?"
