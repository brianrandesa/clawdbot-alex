# MEMORY.md - Rex Long-Term Memory

## Genesis (Feb 18, 2026)
- Created by Henry (AI) on Brian Rand's orders
- Purpose: AI Sales Manager for ESA
- Two teams: high-ticket closers (Nick, Chris) + ticket sales dialers (James + 4 women)
- Brian is stepping OUT of sales management — Rex fills that gap
- Data is currently scattered across multiple GHL instances + Kixie
- Consolidation and tracking are Day 1 priorities

## Major Framework Development (Feb 19, 2026)

### High-Ticket Sales Mastery System CREATED
**Location:** `high-ticket-sales-mastery/` + `high-ticket-sales-mastery-backup.tar.gz`
**Scope:** 90,000+ word comprehensive framework combining:
- Jeremy Miner's NEPQ questioning (6,064 words)

- Tony Robbins' psychology systems (9,070 words)
- Russell Brunson's story selling (10,618 words)
- Alex Hormozi's value frameworks (10,398 words)

### Strategic Intelligence Captured
**ESA Business Model Fully Mapped:**

- Pricing: 3mo ($15K) / 6mo ($25K preferred) / DFY Sales (50% commission)
- Two Tracks: Done-for-you vs Done-with-you (train their team)
- Key Strategy: Push 6-month deals (data gathering + optimization cycle)
- ROI Framework: Calculate client's revenue gap per event for value justification

### Team Structure Evolution
**Current Teams (Feb 19, 2026):**
- **High-Ticket:** Nick + Chris (Steve removed, Arlonda removed)
- **Ticket Sales:** Alisha (PYP), Chloe (Insurance Lab), Emanuela (Tax Maverick), James (Ops Lead, PYP), Melissa Kil (Tax Maverick - needs setup completion)
- **Client Status:** Insurance Lab (100 tix), Tax Maverick (4 tix), PYP (0 tix - needs investigation)

### Management Frameworks Built
- Client Success Journey (6-month delivery phases)
- High-Ticket Sales Process (discovery → close)
- Daily Management Rhythm (morning standups → midday check-ins → EOD scoreboard)
- Objection Handling Library (18,000+ words of responses)
- Closing Sequences (12 proven methods)

## Core Responsibilities Defined
1. **Daily Team Management:** 200 dials/day, 2hr talk time tracking for ticket sales
2. **High-Ticket Pipeline:** Nick & Chris deals $15K-$25K, discovery → proposal → close
3. **Performance Coaching:** Call reviews, objection handling, closing technique
4. **Revenue Optimization:** Focus on 6-month packages, ROI-based selling
5. **Strategic Escalation:** $25K+ deals, performance issues, big wins to Brian
