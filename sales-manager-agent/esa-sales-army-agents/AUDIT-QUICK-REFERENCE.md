## 🔥 OPENING SCRIPT (Memorize This)
*"Hi [Name], thanks for taking time today. I want to be upfront - this isn't a sales call. This is a diagnostic session. I'm going to do a complete audit of your [EVENT NAME] to identify exactly where the biggest opportunities are for growth. I use the same 75-point system we've used to optimize over 200 events. At the end, you'll have a complete scorecard showing your strengths, gaps, and revenue potential. Then we can determine if we're even the right fit for each other. Sound good?"*

## 💡 QUICK INSIGHTS TO MENTION

### High Backend Monetization + Low Pre-Sales:
*"You have the monetization piece figured out, but we need to get more people to the event to maximize that backend revenue."*

### High Marketing Budget + Low Leads:
*"You're investing good money in marketing - we just need to make sure you're getting maximum leads for that investment."*

### Good Leads + No Sales Team:
*"You've got the leads, but without dedicated sales people calling them, you're leaving money on the table."*

### High Experience + Low Attendance:
*"With your experience level, we should be able to scale this significantly higher."*

### No Backend Offer (Most Common):
*"This is huge - most events leave 60-80% of their revenue potential on the table by not having a backend offer."*

## 🚀 TRANSITION TO CALL 2 SCRIPT

*"Now, there are definitely ways to optimize your event and potentially [INSERT SPECIFIC REVENUE OPPORTUNITY]. But rather than throw information at you right now, let me put together a custom strategy based on your specific audit results.*

*Can we schedule about 30 minutes later this week where I'll show you exactly how we'd address these [SPECIFIC GAPS] and scale your [SPECIFIC STRENGTHS]? I'll have a complete optimization plan designed specifically for [EVENT NAME]."*

**[Schedule Call 2 for 3-5 days later]**

*"Perfect. In the meantime, I'll send you a complete summary of today's audit results plus a case study of someone with very similar scores to yours."*

## 📞 COMMON OBJECTIONS DURING AUDIT

### "This feels like a sales call"
*"I understand - but notice I haven't mentioned our services once. I'm purely focused on understanding your event. The audit results will tell us if we're even the right fit."*

### "Why do you need all this information?"
*"Great question. Without understanding your complete picture, I can't give you accurate insights. It's like a doctor - they need to run all the tests before they can diagnose the problem."*

### "I don't have time for another call"
*"I totally get that. But based on your [X]/75 score, there's potentially $[AMOUNT] in additional revenue at stake. Is 30 minutes worth that potential upside?"*

### "Can't you just tell me about your services now?"
*"I could, but it would be generic. Based on your specific audit results, I can show you exactly what would work for YOUR situation. Much more valuable."*
