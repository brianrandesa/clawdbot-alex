# 🎯 NEPQ SCRIPT - 2-CALL RESTRUCTURE
## Based on Henry's Strategic Analysis

---

## 📞 CALL 1: AUDIT/DIAGNOSTIC (25-30 Minutes)

### **STAGE 1: CONNECTION (5 Minutes)**
#### **Expert Positioning Frame:**
*"Hi [Name], thanks for taking time today. I want to be upfront - this isn't a sales call. This is a diagnostic session. I'm going to audit your [EVENT NAME] to identify exactly where the biggest opportunities are for growth. I use the same system we've used to optimize over 200 events. At the end, you'll have a complete scorecard showing your strengths, gaps, and revenue potential. Then we can determine if we're even the right fit for each other. Sound good?"*

#### **Rapport Building:**
- Acknowledge their expertise/industry
- Reference their specific event/challenge  
- Establish consultant-expert dynamic

### **STAGE 2: ENGAGEMENT - EVENT AUDIT (18-20 Minutes)**

#### **Foundation Questions (Event Type & Experience):**
*"Let's start with the basics. Tell me about this event - is this a business conference, workshop, trade show, or what type of event are we dealing with?"*

*"How many times have you hosted events like this?"*

*"What was your attendance at your last similar event?"*

*"And what's your attendance goal for this upcoming event?"*

#### **Monetization Questions:**
*"What are you charging for tickets to this event?"*

*"This is important - do you sell anything AT the event itself? Coaching programs, products, services, anything like that?"*

#### **Marketing & Sales Questions:**
*"How much are you planning to spend on marketing between now and the event?"*

*"Who's currently running your ads - professional agency, in-house team, freelancer, or no one?"*

*"How many leads do you currently have for this specific event?"*

*"How many tickets have you already sold?"*

*"Do you have sales reps actively calling these leads, or is it all self-serve registration?"*

#### **Infrastructure Questions:**
*"Do you use a CRM system to manage and follow up with your leads?"*

*"How would you describe your website - professionally designed and up-to-date, functional but basic, or pretty minimal?"*

*"What's your Instagram following size?"*

*"How many people are on your email list?"*

#### **Authority & Priority Questions:**
*"Are you the person who makes the final decision on marketing investments like this?"*

*"What's your biggest bottleneck right now - marketing and sales, event management, content and speakers, or logistics and operations?"*

#### **CONSEQUENCE/PAIN QUESTIONS (Natural NEPQ Integration):**
*"What happens if you don't hit your attendance goal for this event?"*

*"How much revenue are you leaving on the table if you don't have a backend offer?"*

*"What's the cost of having all these leads but no one calling them?"*

*"If your marketing spend doesn't deliver results, what's that going to mean for future events?"*

### **TRANSITION TO CALL 2 (2 Minutes):**
#### **Score Announcement:**
*"Based on what you've told me, you scored [X] out of 75 points on our Event Success Framework. This puts you in the [TIER] category."*

#### **Problem Amplification:**
*"Here's what I see: You have [STRENGTH], but there are some significant gaps in [GAP 1] and [GAP 2]. Based on your numbers, you're potentially leaving $[AMOUNT] on the table with every event."*

#### **Custom Solution Setup:**
*"Rather than give you a generic solution, I'd like to build something custom for your specific situation. The gaps I identified have very specific solutions, and I want to show you exactly how we'd address them for [EVENT NAME]."*

#### **Call 2 Scheduling:**
*"Can we get the decision makers together for 30 minutes next week? I'll put together a complete optimization strategy based on your audit results, and we can see if it makes sense to work together."*

---

## 📞 CALL 2: PRESENTATION/CLOSE (30-35 Minutes)

### **STAGE 3: TRANSITION - AUDIT RECAP (5 Minutes)**
*"Hi [Name], great to reconnect! Last week we completed the audit of [EVENT NAME], and you scored [X] out of 75 points, putting you in the [TIER] category.*

*Your strongest assets were [TOP 2 STRENGTHS], and your biggest opportunities were [TOP 2 GAPS].*

*Today I want to show you exactly how we'd address those gaps and scale what's already working."*

### **STAGE 4: PRESENTATION - CUSTOM SOLUTION (15-18 Minutes)**

#### **Problem Amplification (Audit-Specific):**
*"Here's what I see happening based on your audit results: [SPECIFIC CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR GAPS]*

*But here's what's possible when we optimize your system: [SPECIFIC REVENUE OPPORTUNITY]*

#### **The ESA Event Optimization System:**
*"Based on your specific audit results, here's the custom system we'd build for [EVENT NAME]:*

**Component 1: [Address Their #1 Gap]**
*Example: "First, we'd create a backend monetization strategy. Based on your [ATTENDANCE] target and [TICKET PRICE], this alone could add $[SPECIFIC AMOUNT] in additional revenue."*

**Component 2: [Address Their #2 Gap]**  
*Example: "Second, we'd implement a dedicated sales process for your [LEAD COUNT] leads. That's like having gold sitting in a vault."*

**Component 3: [Amplify Their #1 Strength]**
*Example: "Third, we'd optimize your [STRENGTH]. You're already investing [BUDGET], so let's make every dollar work harder."*

#### **Proof & Validation:**
*"Let me show you someone with almost identical audit results...*

*[Client Name] scored [SIMILAR SCORE] out of 75, just like you. Same strength: [SHARED STRENGTH]. Same challenge: [SHARED GAP].*

**Results after 90 days:** [SPECIFIC OUTCOMES]

#### **ROI Calculation (Their Numbers):**
*"Based on YOUR specific numbers:*
- *Current potential: $[CURRENT ESTIMATE]*
- *With optimization: $[OPTIMIZED ESTIMATE]*  
- *Additional revenue: $[DIFFERENCE]*
- *This pays for itself with just this one event."*

### **STAGE 5: COMMITMENT - AUDIT-BASED CLOSE (7-10 Minutes)**

#### **Package Presentation (Based on Tier):**

**For Tier A (65-75 points):**
*"Given your strong foundation and high revenue potential, I recommend our Complete Event Optimization System - our 6-month program for businesses ready to scale significantly. Investment: $25,000."*

**For Tier B (50-64 points):**
*"You have two options: Complete System (6-month, $25K) or Foundation Builder (3-month, $15K). I'd recommend the 6-month because your foundation is solid enough."*

**For Tier C (35-49 points):**
*"I recommend our Foundation Builder program - 3 months focused on addressing core gaps before advanced optimization. Investment: $15,000."*

#### **Direct Close (Tier-Specific):**

**Tier A:** *"Based on your audit results and the revenue potential we've identified, does it make sense to move forward with the Complete System?"*

**Tier B:** *"What questions do you have about implementing this optimization system for [EVENT NAME]?"*

**Tier C:** *"How does this foundation-building approach feel for getting [EVENT NAME] to the next level?"*

#### **Objection Handling (Audit-Specific):**

**"I need to think about it":**
*"Based on your audit, what specifically do you need to think through? Your score showed [SPECIFIC GAP] - how much is that gap costing you every month you wait?"*

**"The price is too high":**
*"I understand - but based on your audit results, you're leaving $[REVENUE GAP] on the table with every event. Our program costs $[INVESTMENT] and returns $[ROI AMOUNT]. Which scenario actually costs more?"*

**"I've tried other agencies":**
*"That's exactly why we started with the audit. Most agencies use generic approaches. This system is designed specifically for your [SPECIFIC GAPS AND STRENGTHS] - it's custom-built for [EVENT NAME]."*

#### **Next Steps Close:**
*"Excellent decision. Here's what happens next:*
1. *I'll send the agreement today*
2. *We'll schedule kickoff within 48 hours*  
3. *First optimizations live within 2 weeks*
4. *Results before [EVENT DATE]*

*Any questions about the process?"*
