## 🎯 CALL STRUCTURE (30-35 Minutes)

### **OPENING - AUDIT RECAP (3 Minutes)**
*"Hi [Name], great to reconnect! Last week we completed the audit of [EVENT NAME], and you scored [X] out of 75 points, which put you in the [TIER] category.*

*Just to recap, your strongest assets were [TOP 2 STRENGTHS], and your biggest opportunities were [TOP 2 GAPS].*

*Today I want to show you exactly how we'd address those gaps and scale what's already working for you."*

---

### **PROBLEM AMPLIFICATION (5 Minutes)**

#### For Tier A Prospects (65-75 points):
*"Here's what I see: You have a strong foundation, but you're leaving significant money on the table. Based on your audit results, you're probably generating around [CURRENT ESTIMATE] per event, but with proper optimization, this could easily be [OPTIMIZED ESTIMATE] - that's [DIFFERENCE] more revenue per event."*

#### For Tier B Prospects (50-64 points):
*"Your foundation is solid, but there are some gaps preventing you from reaching your full potential. Right now you're probably hitting about [CURRENT %] of your revenue potential. With the right systems, we could get you to [OPTIMIZED %] or higher."*

#### For Tier C Prospects (35-49 points):
*"There's definite potential here, but some foundation work needs to happen first. Once we address these core issues, the upside is substantial."*

### **Specific Problem Examples:**
- **No Backend Monetization:** *"Without a backend offer, you're leaving 60-80% of your revenue potential untapped."*
- **Poor Lead-to-Sale Conversion:** *"Good leads with no sales process means money walking out the door."*
- **Inefficient Marketing:** *"High ad spend with low returns means every dollar is working harder than it should."*

---

### **SOLUTION FRAMEWORK (12-15 Minutes)**

#### **The ESA Event Optimization System**
*"Based on your specific audit results, here's the custom system we'd build for [EVENT NAME]:"*

### **COMPONENT 1: [Address Their #1 Gap]**
**Example Gap: No Backend Monetization**
*"First, we'd create a backend monetization strategy. Instead of just selling tickets, you'd have a high-value offer at the event itself. Based on your [TICKET PRICE] pricing and [ATTENDANCE] target, this alone could add [SPECIFIC $] in additional revenue."*

**What We'd Do:**
- Design backend offer aligned with your audience
- Create sales presentation and materials  
- Train your team (or provide ours) to convert
- Implement follow-up systems for non-buyers

### **COMPONENT 2: [Address Their #2 Gap]**
**Example Gap: No Sales Infrastructure**
*"Second, we'd implement a dedicated sales process. Right now you have [LEAD COUNT] leads with no one actively calling them. That's like having gold sitting in a vault. We'd put a system in place to convert those leads into ticket sales."*

**What We'd Do:**
- Set up lead qualification and scoring
- Create calling scripts and objection handling
- Implement CRM tracking and follow-up sequences
- Train sales team or provide dedicated reps

### **COMPONENT 3: [Amplify Their #1 Strength]**
**Example Strength: High Marketing Budget**
*"Third, we'd optimize your marketing investment. You're already investing [BUDGET AMOUNT], which shows you understand the importance of marketing. We'd make sure every dollar is working at maximum efficiency."*

**What We'd Do:**
- Audit current ad performance
- Optimize targeting and creative
- Implement advanced tracking and attribution
- Scale what's working, eliminate what's not

---

### **PROOF & VALIDATION (5-7 Minutes)**

#### **Relevant Case Study**
*"Let me show you someone with almost identical audit results to yours...*

**[Client Name]** scored [SIMILAR SCORE] out of 75, just like you. They had the same strength: [SHARED STRENGTH]. And the same challenge: [SHARED GAP].

**BEFORE:** [Previous performance]
**AFTER 90 DAYS:** [Improved performance]  
**KEY RESULT:** [Specific outcome]

*The transformation happened because we addressed the exact same gaps you have and amplified the exact same strengths."*

#### **Specific ROI Calculation**
*"Based on your numbers, here's the math:*
- *Current event potential: [CURRENT ESTIMATE]*
- *With optimization: [OPTIMIZED ESTIMATE]*
- *Additional revenue per event: [DIFFERENCE]*
- *Over 12 months (assuming 2-4 events): [ANNUAL IMPACT]*

*Even if we only hit half of this potential, you're still looking at [CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE] in additional revenue."*

*"What questions do you have about implementing this optimization system for [EVENT NAME]?"*

#### **Educational Close (Tier C):**
*"How does this foundation-building approach feel for getting [EVENT NAME] to the next level?"*

---

## 🛡️ OBJECTION HANDLING

### **"I need to think about it"**
*"Absolutely - this is a significant decision. Based on your audit, what specifically do you need to think through? Is it the investment, the timing, or the approach?"*

**If Investment:** *"I understand - [AMOUNT] is significant. But you're currently leaving [REVENUE GAP] on the table with every event. The question is: can you afford NOT to fix this?"*

**If Timing:** *"When is your next event? If it's [EVENT DATE], we need to start immediately to have everything optimized in time."*

### **"I need to discuss with [partner/team]"**
*"Of course. Based on your audit, what do you think [decision maker] will be most interested in - the revenue upside or the systems improvement?"*

*"Would it be helpful if I joined a brief call with [them] to walk through the audit results?"*

### **"Your price is too high"**
*"I understand price is a consideration. But let's look at this differently - based on your audit results, you're leaving [REVENUE GAP] on the table with every event. Our program will cost [INVESTMENT] and return [ROI AMOUNT]. Which scenario costs more - investing in optimization or continuing to leave money on the table?"*

### **"I've tried other agencies before"**
*"I get that - and that's exactly why we started with the audit. Most agencies use a one-size-fits-all approach. This system is designed specifically for your [SPECIFIC GAPS AND STRENGTHS]. It's not generic - it's custom-built for [EVENT NAME]."*

### **"I want to try some things myself first"**
*"That makes sense, and I respect the DIY approach. But based on your audit, your primary bottleneck is [BOTTLENECK]. How much time do you have before [EVENT DATE]? And what's your experience level with [SPECIFIC SOLUTION NEEDED]?"*

---

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS CLOSE

### **If Yes:**
*"Excellent decision. Here's what happens next:*
1. *I'll send the agreement today*
2. *We'll schedule our kickoff call within 48 hours*
3. *Your first optimizations will be live within 2 weeks*
4. *You'll start seeing results before [EVENT DATE]*

*Any questions about the process?"*

### **If Need to Think/Discuss:**
*"Absolutely. When would be a good time to reconnect? I'd suggest within 48 hours so we can get started if you decide to move forward."*

*"In the meantime, I'll send you the complete case study I mentioned and your detailed audit summary so you have everything you need for your discussion."*
