## PRE-LAUNCH BASELINE MEASUREMENT

### Current Funnel Performance (Need to Establish)
```
METRICS TO MEASURE:
- Landing page conversion rate (visitor to quiz start)
- Quiz completion rate (start to finish)  
- Qualification rate (completion to qualified)
- Booking rate (qualified to booked call)

    activeTests.forEach(testId => {
      const results = this.tracker.getResults(testId);
      this.displayResults(results);
      
      // Alert on significant results

        this.alertSignificantResult(results);
      }
    });
  }
  
  displayResults(results) {
    console.table(results.results);
    
    if (results.significance.significant) {
      console.log(`🎉 Test ${results.testId} has significant results!`);
      console.log(`Winner: ${results.significance.winner}`);
      console.log(`Improvement: ${results.significance.improvement.toFixed(2)}%`);
    }
  }
  
  alertSignificantResult(results) {
    // Send alert to team (Slack notification)
    fetch(process.env.SLACK_WEBHOOK, {

            text: {
              type: 'mrkdwn',
              text: `*Test:* ${results.testId}\n*Winner:* ${results.significance.winner}\n*Improvement:* ${results.significance.improvement.toFixed(2)}%\n*Duration:* ${results.duration} days`

## SUCCESS METRICS & KPIs

### Primary Metrics (Must Improve)
- **Overall Funnel Conversion:** Visitor → Client (Target: 10x current rate)
- **Qualified Lead Quality:** % of qualified leads that book and show up (Target: >90%)
- **Unqualified Call Reduction:** Currently 45% unqualified (Target: <10%)

### Secondary Metrics (Monitor for Trade-offs)
- **Quiz Completion Rate:** Don't sacrifice too much for better quality
- **Page Load Speed:** Maintain <3 second load times
- **Mobile Conversion Rate:** Should match or exceed desktop
- **Cost Per Qualified Lead:** Track across all tests

### Leading Indicators (Early Warning System)
- **Bounce Rate:** Should decrease with better targeting
- **Time on Page:** Should increase with more engaging content
- **Return Visitor Rate:** High-quality prospects should return
- **Referral Traffic:** Satisfied customers should refer others

---

## TEST ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK

### Statistical Requirements
```
MINIMUM SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATION:
Current conversion rate: 1% (estimated)
Minimum detectable effect: 25% improvement
Statistical power: 80%
Significance level: 95%

REQUIRED SAMPLE SIZE: ~5,000 visitors per variant
TIME TO SIGNIFICANCE: 2-3 weeks per test (depending on traffic)
```

### Decision Making Criteria

#### When to Declare a Winner:
1. **Statistical significance achieved** (p < 0.05)
2. **Minimum sample size reached** (5,000+ per variant)  
3. **Test ran minimum duration** (7 days to account for weekly patterns)
4. **Business impact meaningful** (>15% improvement)

#### When to Stop a Test Early:
1. **Major negative impact** (>20% decline in conversions)
2. **Technical issues discovered** (tracking problems, bugs)
3. **External factors** (major news, holidays affecting behavior)

#### When to Continue Testing:
1. **Trending positive but not significant** (extend test duration)
2. **Seasonal variations suspected** (test through full cycle)
3. **Multiple variants close** (run longer for clear winner)

---

## ROLLOUT STRATEGY

### Gradual Implementation Process

#### Phase 1: Validate Winner (10% Traffic)
- Deploy winning variant to small traffic segment
- Monitor for 3-7 days for consistent performance
- Check for any unexpected technical issues
- Verify tracking accuracy

#### Phase 2: Scale Winner (50% Traffic)  
- Increase traffic to winning variant
- Compare performance against remaining control traffic
- Monitor key metrics for stability
- Prepare full rollout

#### Phase 3: Full Implementation (100% Traffic)
- Complete migration to winning variant
- Update all related materials and documentation
- Brief team on changes and impact
- Set baseline for next round of testing

### Risk Mitigation
- **Always maintain 10% control group** during initial rollout
- **Automated rollback triggers** if key metrics decline >10%
- **Manual monitoring first 48 hours** after any major change
- **Backup versions ready** for immediate deployment if needed
