## 🎯 QUALIFICATION FIX (CRITICAL)

### **Problem:** 45% calls unqualified = wasted closer time

### **Solution:** Add disqualifying questions to FB forms:

#### **NEW FORM QUESTIONS:**
1. **"What's your current revenue?"**
   - Under $100K (disqualify)
   - $100K-500K
   - $500K-1M  
   - $1M+ (prioritize)

2. **"Have you hosted a live event before?"**
   - Never (nurture sequence)
   - Once or twice
   - Multiple times (prioritize)

3. **"What's your timeline to launch?"**
   - Just researching (disqualify)
   - 3-6 months
   - Next 30 days (hot lead)

4. **"What's your event budget?"**
   - Under $5K (disqualify)
   - $5K-15K  
   - $15K+ (qualified)

**IMPACT:** Should improve qualification from 45% → 80%
