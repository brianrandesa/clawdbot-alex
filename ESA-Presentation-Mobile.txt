ESA EVENT SALES SYSTEM - HIGH-TICKET PRESENTATION

SLIDE 1: HOOK
"The $500,000 Event That Sold 47 Tickets"

Brian, let me ask you something...
Have you ever seen an event organizer spend 6 months planning their dream event...
Rent the perfect venue for $15,000...
Book world-class speakers for $25,000...
Invest $50,000 in marketing...
Only to watch 47 people show up to a room built for 500?

I've seen it happen 847 times.

SLIDE 2: THE 3 DEADLY PROBLEMS
Problem #1: LOW TICKET SALES
- Average event sells only 12-18% of capacity
- Most organizers rely on "hope marketing"
- No systematic approach

Problem #2: NO PROVEN SYSTEM  
- Winging it with random tactics
- No sales funnel or conversion strategy
- Flying blind without data

Problem #3: MANUAL PROCESSES
- Manually managing every lead
- Spending 60+ hours/week on admin
- Burning out before event happens

SLIDE 3: THE REAL COST
FINANCIALLY:
- Average event loses $87,000 due to poor sales
- Wasted marketing spend: $30K-$150K per event
- Lost opportunity cost: $200K+ potential revenue

EMOTIONALLY:
- Sleepless nights worrying about attendance
- Embarrassment in front of speakers/sponsors
- Relationship-damaging stress
