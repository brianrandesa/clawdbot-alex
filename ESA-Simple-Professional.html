<h1>The Challenge</h1>
<p>Most events fail to reach their attendance goals. We've worked with over 250 events in the past 5 years, and the same pattern emerges: great content, good speakers, solid venue - but poor ticket sales.</p>

<p>The typical event organizer spends months on logistics but only a few weeks thinking about marketing. By the time they realize they need help with ticket sales, it's often too late to implement a proper system.</p>

<h1>Our Background</h1>
<p>Event Sales Agency was founded in 2019 in Miami. We specialize in helping coaches, consultants, and businesses fill their events.</p>

<div class="simple-stats">
<strong>By the numbers:</strong> We've handled 250+ events, sold over 65,000 tickets, and generated more than $65 million in event revenue for our clients.

<h1>Recent Client Results</h1>

<div class="case">
<h2>Deontay Wilder Boxing Event</h2>
<p>Former heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder was hosting an exhibition match in Las Vegas. They had 3 weeks to sell 3,000 tickets.</p>
<p><span class="numbers">Result:</span> Sold out in 18 days using targeted social media campaigns and our email marketing system. Total revenue: $450,000.</p>
</div>

<div class="case">
<h2>Colorado Spartans Football</h2>
<p>Semi-pro football team was averaging about 3,000 fans per game. They wanted to increase attendance for the season.</p>
<p><span class="numbers">Result:</span> Developed a season-long fan acquisition strategy. Average attendance increased to over 5,000 per game. That's a 67% improvement.</p>
</div>

<div class="case">
<h2>Boston Conference</h2>
<p>A religious conference was struggling to reach younger attendees with their traditional marketing approach.</p>
<p><span class="numbers">Result:</span> We used social media advertising and automated follow-up sequences to sell 600 tickets. They had originally budgeted for 500 attendees.</p>
</div>

<h1>How We Work</h1>
<p>Our process is straightforward. We start by understanding your event, your audience, and your goals. Then we build a marketing campaign that actually works.</p>

<p>The key is having a system. Most event organizers try random tactics - a Facebook post here, an email there. We use a 7-phase launch sequence that we've refined over 5 years and 250+ events.</p>

<p>We handle the marketing technology, the ad campaigns, the email sequences, and the follow-up. You focus on delivering a great event.</p>

<h1>Investment</h1>
<p>Our Event Sales System implementation is $15,000. This includes 6 weeks of hands-on work to set up and launch your marketing campaign.</p>

<p>Most clients see this investment returned on their first event. For example, if we increase your ticket sales by just 30% on a typical $150,000 event, that's $45,000 in additional revenue.</p>

<p>We've worked with events ranging from 200 people to 5,000+ attendees. The system scales.</p>

<h1>Timeline</h1>
<p>We typically need 6-8 weeks to implement the full system before your event. This gives us time to research your market, build the campaigns, and launch the ticket sales sequence properly.</p>

<p>If you're planning an event for later this year, now is the time to start the conversation.</p>

<h1>Next Steps</h1>
<p>If this sounds like something that could help your event, let's schedule a call to discuss the details.</p>

<p>We'll need to understand your event format, target audience, venue capacity, and timeline. From there, we can put together a specific plan for your situation.</p>
