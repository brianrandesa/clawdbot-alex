## 🚨 CRITICAL WARNINGS

1. **DO NOT touch the 5 profitable campaigns** until new structure is ready
2. **Quality scores will drop initially** during creative refresh - normal
3. **Facebook may increase CPMs** during campaign restructuring - temporary
4. **Learning phases** will reset - budget 2-3 weeks for optimization
5. **Competitor response** - expect CPCs to rise as we scale

---

## 📞 CONCLUSION

The current Facebook Ads account is a complete disaster, but the bones of a successful system are there. The "We fill rooms" creative and Consultant audiences are proven winners. Storm Leroy creative is killing profitability and must be eliminated immediately.

With proper restructuring, creative refresh, and budget reallocation, we can easily 2x performance within 90 days. The historical sales data of $727K proves the market demand exists - we just need to stop wasting money on terrible campaigns and scale what works.

**Next call:** Schedule immediate kill session for worst performers, then rapid deployment of new structure.
