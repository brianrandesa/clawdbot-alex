# ESA EVENT SALES FUNNEL 2.0 - MASTER PROJECT PLAN
## The Complete Rebuild Strategy for 10x Conversion Results

---

## 🎯 PROJECT MISSION STATEMENT

**Transform Brian's Event Sales System funnel from a poorly converting lead generator into the most optimized conversion machine on the planet, targeting $15K Event Sales System buyers with a goal of 10x current conversion rates while eliminating the 45% unqualified call problem.**

---

## 📊 CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

### Critical Issues Identified:
1. **Qualification Failure:** Simple 4-question quiz allows 45% unqualified prospects to book calls
2. **Generic Positioning:** "We Fill Your Events" doesn't leverage ESA's premium market position
3. **Missing Trust Elements:** No guarantee, weak FAQ section, poor social proof presentation
4. **Structural Problems:** Doesn't follow Insurance Growth Conference gold standard design
5. **Mobile Experience:** Not optimized for 50%+ mobile traffic

### Performance Baseline (Estimated):
- **Current Overall Conversion:** ~0.86% (visitor to client)
- **Target Overall Conversion:** 8.6% (10x improvement)
- **Unqualified Call Rate:** 45% (target: <10%)
- **Quiz Completion:** ~60% (target: >75%)
