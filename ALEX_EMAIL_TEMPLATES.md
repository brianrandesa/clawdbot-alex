## EMAIL 1: Main Outreach (The System Question)

**Subject:** Quick question about your next event

**Body:**
```
Hey {{first_name}},

I saw you're hosting {{event_name}}. Nice.

Quick question: do you have a system that actually fills seats, or are you running ads and hoping for the best?

We built a done-for-you event sales system that's filled 250+ events and sold 65,000+ tickets. One client sold 3,000 tickets in 3 weeks. Another sold 600 tickets using AI with zero human sales reps.

We install your CRM, build your funnels, launch your ads, and train your team all in a 7-week sprint. Not a course. A fully built machine.

Worth a 15-minute call to see if it fits?

## EMAIL 2: Pattern Interrupt (The Broken System)

**Subject:** Your ads aren't the problem

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Most event hosts think they have an ads problem.

They don't. They have a broken event system.

We've filled 250+ events (65,000+ tickets sold). The ones who struggle all have the same issue: no system connecting the ad to the sale.

We install the whole machine. CRM, funnels, ads, automation, team training. 7 weeks. One client sold 3,000 tickets in 3 weeks using it.

15 minutes to see if your system has gaps?

## EMAIL 3: Social Proof Heavy

**Subject:** How we sold 3,000 tickets in 3 weeks

**Body:**
```
{{first_name}},

Quick story:

Deontay Wilder's team came to us with an event. We built their sales system from scratch. CRM, funnels, ads, automation.

Result: 3,000 tickets sold in 3 weeks.

Another client (Boston faith conference): 600 tickets sold using AI automation. Zero human sales reps.

We've done this for 250+ events. $65M+ in revenue generated.

The pattern: event hosts think they need better ads. What they actually need is a system that converts.

We build the whole thing in 7 weeks. Done-for-you.

**Subject:** One question before I close your file

**Body:**
```

Last touch before I close your file.

Most event hosts struggle with the same thing: they think they need better ads. What they actually need is a system that connects the ad to the sale.

If your event isn't filling the way you want, there's a reason. And it's fixable.
