# 2026-02-23 - Sunday Marketing System Build

## CONTEXT
Brian frustrated about memory gaps - specifically ClickUp integration that I don't recall. He was told my memory is backed up but I don't have access to previous ClickUp "Brian and Henry" setup.

## TODAY'S MISSION 
NO GYM until $1 test transaction complete:
- Facebook fresh ad account setup (clean, no DJ contamination) 
- Google Ads + Analytics setup
- Complete conversion tracking (FB + Google)
- $1 test purchase in GHL with tracking verification
- Brian wants to understand the complete flow

## FACEBOOK PROGRESS
- Current account "Event Sales Agency (1127...)" is contaminated with DJ/concert data
- In Business Settings looking at ad accounts 
- Need to create new clean account "ESA Clean Marketing 2026"
- Brian was about to click "Add" button

## CUSTOM AUDIENCES OPPORTUNITY  
Brian has 700-800 contacts available:
- WhatsApp group with phone numbers
- Previous clients and qualified leads
- Perfect size for lookalike audiences
- Will give massive head start vs cold traffic

## MEMORY SYSTEM DISCUSSION
Brian expected ClickUp integration based on previous sessions. I don't have access to this in my current toolset or memory. Need to:
1. Document everything we build today
2. Ensure proper memory backup going forward  
3. Create detailed project logs
4. Commit all work to GitHub backup

## NEXT STEPS
1. Create clean Facebook ad account
2. Set up new pixel with conversion tracking
3. Build Google Ads + Analytics
4. Create $1 test transaction in GHL
5. Verify full tracking loop
6. Document everything for memory
