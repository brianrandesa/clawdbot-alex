# GHL + Vibe Code + Pixel Strategy - Feb 23, 2026

## TECHNICAL CLARIFICATION FROM BRIAN:

### **Current Setup:**
- **Vibe code = HTML/CSS** that Brian copies and pastes into GHL funnel pages
- **Not a separate custom site** - still using GHL as the platform
- **Question:** What's the best way to get proper pixel tracking on GHL pages?

### **Options Discussed:**
1. **GHL Header + Vibe Code Below** - Put pixel in GHL page header, custom HTML below
2. **Full GHL Integration** - Pixel + vibe code all within GHL
3. **Hybrid Approach** - Custom landing page that redirects to GHL for booking

### **Pixel Tracking Challenges in GHL:**
- **GHL's pixel integration** - may not capture all custom events properly
- **Custom HTML injection** - need to ensure pixel fires on all funnel steps
- **Conversion tracking** - booking confirmations, form submissions, etc.

### **RECOMMENDATION NEEDED:**
Brian wants to know the best technical approach for:
- Proper Facebook pixel tracking
- Clean vibe code integration
- Reliable conversion events
- Professional appearance

### **Key Question:**
What gives the most reliable pixel tracking while maintaining the "vibe code" aesthetic Brian loves?
