## Evening Session (8-11:30 PM)

### ESA Studio Fixes
- **Auth wall removed** — disabled login requirement so app loads straight to dashboard
- **Generator bug fixed** — Ad Copy, Email, SMS, VSL generators were calling API but never displaying content (setOutput was missing). All 4 fixed and pushed.
- **Git author fixed** — changed from `brianrandesa@gmail.com` to `brian@eventsalesagency.com` so Vercel deploys work (Hobby plan requires matching team email)
- **Deploy method:** Use deploy hook or git push (NOT `npx vercel` — author mismatch blocks it). Vercel auto-deploys from GitHub pushes now.
- **Banner fun:** Denise tested by adding "Denise is AWESOME" banner, changed colors multiple times (pink final)

### Denise Brooks Setup — COMPLETED
- **GitHub:** Added as collaborator `denise-cpu` with Write access on `brianrandesa/esa-studio`
- **Cursor IDE:** Installed on her MacBook Pro (user: dbrooks), cloned repo to Desktop
- **Git config set:** `denise@eventsalesagency.com` / `Denise Brooks`
- **Her machine:** MacBook Pro, no Node.js installed, had to install Xcode CLI tools for git
- **Setup guide:** `DENISE-SETUP-GUIDE.md` committed to repo
- **She successfully pushed code** — banner change deployed to production
- **Cursor > Claude Code** for non-devs (visual, less friction)
- **GitHub Codespaces** recommended as zero-setup alternative

### Group Chat Setup — Brian & Henry, Denise
- **Telegram group created** with Brian, Denise, and Henry bot
- **Key fix:** `requireMention: false` set for group `-5250257382` in OpenClaw config
- **groupPolicy changed to "open"** (was "allowlist")
- **Privacy mode** confirmed disabled via BotFather
- **Bot removed/re-added** multiple times to apply privacy mode change
- **Final config:** Groups open, no mention required — I respond to all messages

### OpenClaw Config Changes
- `channels.telegram.groupPolicy`: "allowlist" → "open"
- `channels.telegram.groups.-5250257382.requireMention`: false
- Two restarts applied via config.patch

### Recommendations Given to Brian
- **Cursor IDE** over Claude Code for him and Denise (visual, easier)
- **Git + push workflow** over VPN (parallel work, tracked changes, auto-deploy)
- Listed 10 things to build next, ranked by revenue impact
- Top picks: Marketing Director agent, Rex go-live, Lead Qualification Bot, Client ROI Dashboard
