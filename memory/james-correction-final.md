# FINAL JAMES CORRECTION - Feb 23, 2026

## BRIAN'S CLARIFICATION:
- **"every James M is James Mungai"**
- This means in the PAYROLL data, when I saw "James M", it was James Mungai the ticket sales rep
- **I incorrectly created "James Murphy" as Sales Manager** - this role doesn't exist
- **James Mungai is ONLY a ticket sales team member**

## WHAT I DID WRONG:
- Saw "James M" in payroll and assumed it meant James Murphy (Sales Manager)
- Created a fictional Sales Manager role
- Added $1,500 bi-weekly salary for non-existent person

## THE TRUTH:
- **James Mungai** = ticket sales rep (hourly/commission)
- **No dedicated Sales Manager role exists**
- **Malachi Broadway** = Sales Lead (manages sales activities)

## CORRECTED LEADERSHIP:
- Brian Rand - CEO
- Malachi Broadway - Sales Lead  
- Denise Brooks - COO
- (No separate Sales Manager exists)

## WHO MANAGES SALES TEAMS:
- Likely Brian directly or Malachi as Sales Lead
- Need confirmation from Brian on actual structure
