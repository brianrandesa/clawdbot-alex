# Malachi Context - Ad Account Issues (Feb 23, 2026)

## CRITICAL CONTEXT FROM BRIAN:

### **Why We Need New Ad Account:**
- **Malachi was Marketing Manager** - handled the old ad account
- **Malachi "messed up" the old account** - this is the ROOT CAUSE of current problems
- **Starting completely fresh** to avoid contaminated data/pixel issues

### **Team Development:**
- **Malachi trained Zo & So** - Muhammad Zohaib + Sohaib Iqbal as junior media buyers
- **They now handle client ads** - both DFY and DWY campaigns
- **Malachi moving out** - creates both personal/professional transition

### **ESA Service Offerings (Full Picture):**
1. **Done-For-You (DFY)** - ESA runs all ads for clients  
2. **Done-With-You (DWY)** - ESA assists/manages client ad campaigns
3. **Event Sales System (ESS)** - $15K high-ticket offer

### **Current Ad Strategy:**
- **Brian taking direct control** - working hands-on with Henry (me)
- **Zo & So handle client campaigns** - ESA's media buying team
- **Fresh Facebook account** - clean slate, proper tracking, no contamination

### **Next Steps:**
- Focus on NEW ad account creation
- Build clean tracking system  
- Brian + Henry collaboration on strategy
- Details on DFY/DWY offers to discuss later

## **KEY TAKEAWAY:**
The reason we're rebuilding everything from scratch is because Malachi (previous marketing manager) created problems with the old account. Brian is now taking direct control to ensure it's done right.
