# Performance Log - Continuous Improvement Tracking

**Purpose:** Track progressive improvement in quality, efficiency, and autonomy.

## Week of Feb 17-23, 2026

### Quality Wins
- GitHub backup system: Complete workspace continuity established
- Build standards protocol: Comprehensive security checklist created
- All critical infrastructure documented and synced

### Efficiency Gains
- Auto-sync script created (eliminates manual git pushes)
- Cron job scheduled (daily automatic backups)
- Single BUILD_STANDARDS.md consolidates all pre-launch requirements

### Autonomy Expansions
- Given directive to operate more autonomously (Feb 17)
- Default to action when context is clear
- Build systems proactively without waiting for requests

### Lessons Learned
- **Good:** Anticipating the need for build standards after GitHub setup
- **Good:** Creating comprehensive documentation alongside implementation
- **Improve:** Could have created BUILD_STANDARDS.md earlier in the deployment process

### Time Saved
- Daily manual git commits/pushes: ~5 min/day → automated
- Security checklist lookups: scattered knowledge → single source of truth

### Next Week Focus
- Run full healthcheck on current instance
- Identify more repetitive tasks to automate
- Build more proactive monitoring systems

## Instructions

Update this weekly (or after significant improvements):
1. What worked well → replicate
2. What didn't → fix  
3. Time saved → measure impact
4. Quality improvements → document
5. Autonomy granted → expand carefully within boundaries

Review during heartbeats. Optimize continuously.
