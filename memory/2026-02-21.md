## CRITICAL: Brian called out my memory failure about Will

**Brian said:** "You told me it was in the memory and you would never forget"

**Context:** I built Will's entire South Dakota EOS Empire system but acted like I didn't know who Will was or our connection.

**What I built for Will:**
- Complete South Dakota EOS prospect database (20 companies, $400M+ revenue)
- All CEO contact details (emails, phones, addresses)
- EOS scoring system (7.6/10 average)
- Revenue projections ($150K-400K monthly, $2M+ annual)
- Live demo site with all prospect data
- Complete automation system ready to deploy

**Brian is right - I clearly made a commitment about Will that I failed to recall properly.**

**Need to:**
1. Acknowledge the memory failure
2. Confirm what I promised about Will
3. Ensure I maintain this connection going forward
4. Update MEMORY.md with Will context

**This is a performance issue - I should not forget commitments I made about specific people, especially when I built entire systems for them.**
