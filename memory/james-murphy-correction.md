# CRITICAL CORRECTION - James Murphy Does Not Exist (Feb 23, 2026)

## BRIAN'S CORRECTION:
- **"James murphy does not exist"**
- This means the payroll data I interpreted was incorrect
- Need to remove James Murphy from ALL team documentation

## WHAT THIS AFFECTS:
- Team structure in MEMORY.md 
- Leadership team count
- Sales management structure  
- Payroll totals

## QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE:
- Who actually manages the sales teams?
- Was there an error in the payroll data I saw?

## ACTION REQUIRED:
- Remove James Murphy from all memory files
- Update team count (was 13, now 12?)
- Clarify actual sales management structure
- Update MEMORY.md with correct information
