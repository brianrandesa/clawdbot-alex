# URGENT: ESA Video Editor - Same Day Build

**Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Urgency:** CRITICAL - Clients in queue  
**Deadline:** TODAY (by evening)  
**Requester:** Denise Brooks (ESA Fulfillment)

## BUSINESS CONTEXT

**Current Problem:**
- ESA processes 10-12 client VSL videos per month
- Current team delivers "Grade D" quality
- Lots of client rework/back-and-forth
- Denise has clients waiting in queue TODAY

**Required Solution:**
- Grade A/B quality video editing
- Intelligent B-roll placement
- Real video processing (not mockup)
- Integrated into ESA Studio (not separate system)

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

### Quality Standards (Confirmed by Denise):
- **B-roll segments:** 3-5 seconds each
- **Placement timing:** Every 8-12 seconds
- **Ratio:** 60% talking head, 40% B-roll
- **Movement/Dynamic:** Camera pans, people working, not static
- **Content matching:** Power words trigger relevant B-roll
- **VSL optimization:** Hook = minimal B-roll, Problem = pain imagery, Solution = success imagery

### Integration Requirements:
- **Platform:** ESA Studio (new tab)
- **Input:** MP4 files via upload
- **Process:** AI script analysis → B-roll placement → Professional output
- **Output:** Downloadable edited video
- **Workflow:** Upload → AI first pass → Human review → Client delivery

### Technical Stack:
- **Backend:** Real FFmpeg processing (not mockup)
- **Frontend:** React component in ESA Studio
- **AI:** Script analysis for power words, emotional moments
- **Storage:** Handle MP4 files, B-roll library

## BUILD PLAN (Same Day)

### Phase 1 (0-2 hours): Core Engine
- [ ] FFmpeg video processing backend
- [ ] Script analysis AI (detect power words)
- [ ] B-roll timing algorithm (8-12 second intervals)
- [ ] Basic upload/download functionality

### Phase 2 (2-4 hours): ESA Studio Integration
- [ ] New "Video Editor" tab in ESA Studio
- [ ] Upload interface matching ESA Studio design
- [ ] Progress tracking and preview
- [ ] Download processed videos

### Phase 3 (4-6 hours): Quality & Testing
- [ ] Implement Denise's Grade A standards
- [ ] Test with sample VSL videos
- [ ] Refine B-roll placement algorithm
- [ ] Ready for Denise testing by 8-9 PM EST

### Phase 4 (Evening): Refinement
- [ ] Denise testing and feedback
- [ ] Overnight refinements
- [ ] Ready for client queue processing

## SUCCESS METRICS

- [ ] **REAL video processing** (downloads working edited videos)
- [ ] **B-roll placement matches Grade A standards**
- [ ] **Integrated into ESA Studio** (no separate systems)
- [ ] **Unblocks client queue TODAY**
- [ ] **Reduces Denise's rework KPI**

## CRITICAL NOTES

- **No more mockups/demos** - this must actually work
- **Client deadline driving urgency** - business impact if delayed
- **Denise available for testing around 6-8 PM EST**
- **Focus on minimum viable to process client queue**
- **Can refine/expand features after initial delivery**

**Status: IN PROGRESS - Building now for same-day delivery**
