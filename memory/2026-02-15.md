## Henry Sales Assistant Project - Full Setup

### Project Overview
Launched "Henry" - an automated AI sales assistant for Event Sales Agency (ESA) to run cold email outbound campaigns targeting event organizers. Goal: Book sales calls with business coaches, consultants, speakers, and course creators who use events as sales channels for high-ticket ($5K+) backend offers.

### Cost Optimization Decision
- **Switched from Claude Sonnet 4.5 to Haiku 3.5** for 80-90% cost reduction
- Strategy: Prove the system works with lower costs before scaling
- Config updated in openclaw.json

### Email Infrastructure Established
- **Email:** henrythesalesguy@gmail.com
- **Password:** Harrythesalesguy1234
- **App Password (SMTP):** chmhamwlufyjgtly
- **SMTP Config:** smtp.gmail.com:587 (TLS)
- **2-Step Verification:** Enabled
- **Test email:** Successfully sent to denise@eventsalesagency.com
- **Calendly:** https://calendly.com/henrythesalesguy/30min

### Google Cloud & Sheets API Setup (In Progress)
- **Project Name:** Henry Sales Automation
- **Project ID:** henry-sales-automation
- **Project Number:** 100636368312
- **Sheets API:** Enabled
- **Status:** Creating service account credentials for automated logging
- **Tracking Sheet:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ll-ouNpaAzJzOun8ZniA1quYbmrRnjkxltb8lEsW5Sw/edit?usp=sharing

### Web Search API
- **Brave API Key:** BSAWQ3nc7E07-zuO2g_E8gCbzC22XeO (configured)

### Email Templates Created
Created 4 email templates + 3-touch follow-up sequence in `HENRY_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md`:
- Main subject line: "Quick question about your next event"
- Templates focus on pain points: broken event systems, not just ad problems
- Social proof: 250+ events, 65K+ tickets, $65M+ revenue
- Case studies: Deontay Wilder (3K tickets/3 weeks), Colorado Spartans (3K→5K tickets/game), Boston faith conference (600 tickets via AI, zero human reps)

### Target Audience
- **Include:** Business coaches, consultants, speakers, course creators with high-ticket backends and events
- **Exclude:** DJs, wedding planners, party planners, festivals, clubs, photographers, caterers

### Sending Strategy
- Start conservative: 10-20 emails/day
- Scale to 30-50/day based on results
- Target response rate: >5%
- Track everything in Google Sheets

### Key Files Created
- `HENRY_SALES_CONFIG.md` - Main configuration
- `HENRY_EMAIL_TEMPLATES.md` - All email templates
- `HENRY_GMAIL_SMTP.md` - SMTP details
- `send-test-email.js` - Working test script (nodemailer installed)
- `HENRY_READY_TO_SEND.md` - Launch readiness checklist

### Next Steps
1. Complete Google Sheets API service account setup
2. Build first prospect list (50 qualified event organizers)
3. Send first 10 test emails
4. Monitor and track results
5. Scale based on response rates

### Messaging Framework
Key differentiator: "Most event hosts think they have an ads problem—they actually have a broken event system"
