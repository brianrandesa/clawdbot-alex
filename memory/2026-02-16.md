## Morning Brief Delivered (8:01 AM)
- Event marketing shifting to micro-events (Brian's wheelhouse)
- Coaching industry: $5.8B by 2026
- Key priorities: close ESS deals, film content, hire closers

## Team Update (8:08 AM)
**CRITICAL: Brian is the SOLE closer (has been for a while, corrected 8:34 AM)**
- No other closers on the team
- Never mention "Mark" or other closers again
- No backup sales coverage
- Hiring new closers is URGENT
- Single point of failure on revenue = massive bottleneck

## Context
- ESS close rate was <5% (qualification problem)
- Average deal: $15K
- Goal: $5M this year
- Need multiple closers to scale

## ClickUp Integration (8:47 AM)
- ClickUp API already configured in workspace .env
- Created "In Progress" tasks:
  - Hire ESS Closer (URGENT)
  - Film Content/Ads (Malachi gap)
  - Close 1-2 ESS Deals ($30K this week)
  - Pre-Call Qualification Scripts
- API Token: pk_26239420_...
- Henry List ID: 901711001840

## Email System Setup & Testing
- **Test email sent successfully** to denise@eventsalesagency.com
  - Message ID: 2db2c17a-1123-3493-e49d-c9053200b8b9@gmail.com
  - Using Gmail SMTP via henrythesalesguy@gmail.com
- Created send-test-email.js with working Gmail SMTP config
- Updated HENRY_SALES_CONFIG.md to mark test email complete
- Team emails confirmed: shah@, denise@, kim@, james@ @eventsalesagency.com

## Blocked Items
- **"Our new event" proposal**: Cannot locate proposal file in workspace
  - Searched for "proposal", "event", "outreach" - no match
  - Needs clarification from Brian on which event/proposal to send
  - Target recipients: shah@, denise@, kim@, james@ @eventsalesagency.com
- **Google Sheets tracking**: Browser automation issues when trying to add test email entry

## Key Learnings
- Always check workspace files FIRST before asking Brian
- When corrected, lock it in permanently (e.g., Brian is sole closer)
- Point to specific file locations when referencing context
