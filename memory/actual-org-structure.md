# Actual ESA Organizational Structure - Feb 23, 2026

## REAL REPORTING STRUCTURE (From Brian):

### **CEO LEVEL:**
- **Brian Rand** - CEO

### **DIRECT REPORTS TO BRIAN:**
- **Denise Brooks** - COO (oversees all departments)
- **James Mungai** - Ticket Sales Team Lead (player-coach, been with ESA since day one)
- **Nick Granberry & Chris Granberry** - High-ticket closers (Brian oversees directly)
- **Malachi Broadway** - Sales Lead

### **TEAM STRUCTURE:**
- **James Mungai** = Player-coach (does ticket sales + manages ticket sales team)
- **Brian** = Directly manages high-ticket closers (Nick & Chris)  
- **Denise** = COO oversight of all departments
- **Malachi** = Sales Lead (role to be clarified in future org chart discussion)

### **TICKET SALES TEAM (Reports to James Mungai):**
- Alisha W
- Chloe S  
- Emanuela B
- Melissa K
- James Mungai (player-coach - does sales + manages team)

## KEY INSIGHT:
James Mungai is NOT just a ticket sales rep. He's a day-one employee who manages the entire ticket sales operation while also selling tickets himself (player-coach model).

**Brian wants to discuss full org chart later - focus on ads now.**
