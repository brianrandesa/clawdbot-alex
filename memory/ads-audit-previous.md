# Previous Ads Audit Findings (from prior session)

## Key Numbers
- **$13.3K spent** → 98 booked calls → only 3 closed (3%)
- **45% of calls NOT QUALIFIED** — form letting everyone through
- **$727K historical sales data** — Image #2 made $55K, Top Lookalikes made $50K

## Kill List (from previous audit)
- 🔴 All Storm Leroy ad sets ($2,255 burned, $74-125/conv, zero closes)
- 🔴 Pace Morby ad sets ($1,011 burned, $101-136/conv, zero closes)
- 🔴 MOF Retargeting Awareness ($2,109 on reach, "Below Average" quality on almost every ad)
- 🔴 TOF Belief Shifting ($597, only 48 clicks total)

## Keep & Scale
- 🟢 All Lookalikes - We Sell Out Events ($46/conv, best BOF performer)
- 🟢 Consultants Top 25% - "We fill rooms" ($24/lead)
- 🟢 Reactivate All Lookalikes - Classic Testimonials ($22/conv, cheapest)

## Critical Fix
- Add disqualifying questions to FB form (budget range, event timeline, hosted before)
- Could save $160-200/day

## 5-Phase ESA Growth Machine Plan
1. **Stop the Bleeding** — kill bad ads, fix GHL qual form, clean to 3 campaigns max
2. **Ad Rebuild** — pull winning creatives, new variations, Lookalikes + Consultants targeting, proper TOF/MOF/BOF
3. **Content Strategy** — audit all socials, content calendar, organic → warm → retarget → close
4. **Sales Infrastructure** — qual scorecard, lead routing, cold list (94 prospects), GHL pipeline, reporting
5. **Scale** — test new creatives weekly, auto-kill rules, scale winners to $200-500/day, add YouTube/LinkedIn

## 5 Sub-Agents Planned
1. 🔴 **Ad Copy Engine** — analyzes winning copy patterns, builds new variations
2. 🟡 **Audience Architect** — rebuilds targeting structure from data
3. 🟢 **Funnel Optimizer** — fixes qualification flow
4. 🔵 **Creative Director** — designs new ad concepts based on top performers
5. ⚡ **Campaign Builder** — puts it all together into clean TOF/MOF/BOF

## Still Needed
- Ad preview screenshots/links for top performers (Image #2, Latest Image Ad 2nd, Instant Form, AI Ad #6, Image #1, Testimonial #1)
- These are the creative DNA needed to build new variations
