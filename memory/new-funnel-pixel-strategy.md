# New Funnel + Pixel Strategy - Feb 23, 2026

## BRIAN'S DECISION: BUILD NEW FUNNEL (NOT GHL)

### **Why New Funnel:**
- **Loves the "vibe code" style** Claude Code built
- **Want pixel on custom site** (not GHL)
- **More control over tracking** and user experience

### **Funnel Flow Design:**
1. **Landing page** (vibe coded website)
2. **Qualification form** (filter quality leads)  
3. **Booking form** (calendar booking)
4. **Booked call confirmation** (conversion complete)

### **Pixel Tracking Events:**
- **PageView** - Landing page visit
- **ViewContent** - Form engagement
- **InitiateCheckout** - Qualification started  
- **Purchase/Lead** - Call successfully booked

### **Technical Setup:**
- **GitHub repo:** Already exists with ESA landing page code
- **Build together:** Brian + Henry collaboration
- **Style:** "Vibe code" aesthetic (clean, modern)
- **Platform:** Custom coded (React/HTML), deployed to Vercel

### **Next Steps:**
1. Set up Facebook pixel in Events Manager
2. Plan pixel event structure for funnel flow
3. Build/modify the landing page with pixel integration
4. Test $1 transaction through complete funnel

## KEY INSIGHT:
This isn't just about ads - we're building a complete custom funnel with proper conversion tracking, moving away from GHL dependency.
