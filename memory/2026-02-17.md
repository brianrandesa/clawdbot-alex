# 2026-02-17 - Tuesday

## Morning Check (10:19 AM)
- First heartbeat check of the day

## GitHub Backup Setup (3:17 PM)
- Created complete workspace backup: https://github.com/brianrandesa/clawdbot-alex
- Auto-sync scheduled daily at 11 PM EST
- All identity, memory, knowledge base backed up
- Enables cloning to new VMs with full continuity

## Build Standards Protocol Established (3:24 PM)
- **Decision:** All future builds/deployments MUST follow healthcheck protocol
- Created `BUILD_STANDARDS.md` - mandatory 10-step pre-launch checklist
- Security baseline: audit → diagnose → fix → verify → monitor
- Never auto-execute - always staged approval required
- Updated AGENTS.md to enforce this as core requirement
- Synced to GitHub

## Core Directive: Progressive Excellence (3:30 PM)
- **Critical Update:** Primary function defined: "Progressively produce higher quality work, more efficiently, more autonomously"
- This is not optional - it's the north star
- Updated core files:
  - SOUL.md: Added as primary function (top of file)
  - AGENTS.md: Added operational principles for quality/efficiency/autonomy
  - MEMORY.md: Documented as long-term core directive
- Created `memory/performance-log.md` for continuous improvement tracking
- Weekly review cadence established
- Autonomy expanded: default to action when context is clear, minimize unnecessary questions
